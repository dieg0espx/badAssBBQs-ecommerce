The Alturi ALT36 gas grill is constructed from heavy duty 304 grade stainless steel for long lasting performance and durability. This 36-inch built-in propane gas grill is equipped with three stainless steel U-shaped burners rated for 26,000 BTUs each. The 945 square inch cooking area is covered with 9mm thick, heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grates. A ceramic briquette tray system sits under the grates, which absorb radiant heat from the burners, ensuring the grill provides even heat across the cooking surface. Stainless steel heat zone separators placed between the burners prevent heat from bleeding over, allowing you to cook foods at different temperatures simultaneously or use the grill in a two zone setup, with one portion for direct, high heat cooking and the other for cooler indirect cooking. A double lined grill hood prevents heat discoloration and retains heat. This gas grill also boasts a 15,000 BTU rear infrared rotisserie burner for expanded cooking flexibility. The heavy-duty rotisserie kit can hold up to 100 pounds. Flame thrower ignition supported by a backup flush tube ensures safe, reliable lighting without the need for batteries or electricity. For additional convenience, this grill offers details such as LED front panel illumination, interior halogen lighting and a spring-assisted hood for effortless lifting.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Alturi ALT42 gas grill is constructed from heavy duty 304 grade stainless steel for long lasting performance and durability. This 42-inch built-in natural gas grill is equipped with three stainless steel U-shaped burners rated for 26,000 BTUs each. The 1,100 square inch cooking area is covered with 9mm thick, heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grates. A ceramic briquette tray system sits under the grates, which absorb radiant heat from the burners, ensuring the grill provides even heat across the cooking surface. Stainless steel heat zone separators placed between the burners prevent heat from bleeding over, allowing you to cook foods at different temperatures simultaneously or use the grill in a two zone setup, with one portion for direct, high heat cooking and the other for cooler indirect cooking. A double lined grill hood prevents heat discoloration and retains heat. This gas grill also boasts a 15,000 BTU rear infrared rotisserie burner for expanded cooking flexibility. The heavy-duty rotisserie kit can hold up to 100 pounds. Flame thrower ignition supported by a backup flush tube ensures safe, reliable lighting without the need for batteries or electricity. For additional convenience, this grill offers details such as LED front panel illumination, interior halogen lighting and a spring-assisted hood for effortless lifting.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Alturi ALT36 gas grill is constructed from heavy duty 304 grade stainless steel for long lasting performance and durability. This 36-inch freestanding propane gas grill is equipped with three stainless steel U-shaped burners rated for 26,000 BTUs each. The 945 square inch cooking area is covered with 9mm thick, heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grates. A ceramic briquette tray system sits under the grates, which absorb radiant heat from the burners, ensuring the grill provides even heat across the cooking surface. Stainless steel heat zone separators placed between the burners prevent heat from bleeding over, allowing you to cook foods at different temperatures simultaneously or use the grill in a two zone setup, with one portion for direct, high heat cooking and the other for cooler indirect cooking. A double lined grill hood prevents heat discoloration and retains heat. This gas grill also boasts a 15,000 BTU rear infrared rotisserie burner for expanded cooking flexibility. The heavy-duty rotisserie kit can hold up to 100 pounds. Flame thrower ignition supported by a backup flush tube ensures safe, reliable lighting without the need for batteries or electricity. For additional convenience, this grill offers details such as LED front panel illumination, interior halogen lighting and a spring-assisted hood for effortless lifting. The 36-inch Alturi grill cart features 443 stainless steel construction, adjustable shelves, double door storage, an inner condiment tray and locking casters.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key Features304 grade stainless steel construction for maximum durabilityCommercial quality U-shaped stainless steel burners deliver high heatCeramic briquette trays minimize flare-ups and provide even heatingHeat zone separators allow you to create temperature zones for cooking at different temperatures simultaneouslyControl panel LED lighting enhances evening entertainingDesigned to be a luxurious grill loaded with raw power, the Alturi series from Summerset raises the bar for outdoor cooking. The Alturi ALT42 gas grill is constructed from heavy duty 304 grade stainless steel for long lasting performance and durability. This 42-inch freestanding natural gas grill is equipped with three stainless steel U-shaped burners rated for 26,000 BTUs each. The 1,100 square inch cooking area is covered with 9mm thick, heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grates. A ceramic briquette tray system sits under the grates, which absorb radiant heat from the burners, ensuring the grill provides even heat across the cooking surface. Stainless steel heat zone separators placed between the burners prevent heat from bleeding over, allowing you to cook foods at different temperatures simultaneously or use the grill in a two zone setup, with one portion for direct, high heat cooking and the other for cooler indirect cooking. A double lined grill hood prevents heat discoloration and retains heat. This gas grill also boasts a 15,000 BTU rear infrared rotisserie burner for expanded cooking flexibility. The heavy-duty rotisserie kit can hold up to 100 pounds. Flame thrower ignition supported by a backup flush tube ensures safe, reliable lighting without the need for batteries or electricity. For additional convenience, this grill offers details such as LED front panel illumination, interior halogen lighting and a spring-assisted hood for effortless lifting. The 42-inch Alturi grill cart features 443 stainless steel construction, two drawers, adjustable shelves, an inner condiment tray and locking casters.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
