Made in the USA from 304 stainless steel, the 36-Inch ARTP-36C-NG freestanding natural gas grill features a seamless welded double-walled hood for exceptional heat retention, as well as a full length handle and an easy-open spring-assisted system. Three stainless steel tube U-burners each produce 20,000 BTUs, which evenly distribute high heat across the cooking surface. Electrical wires and connectors are also encapsulated with heat-resistant silicone, making the 110v electrical ignition system fast and reliable, while fully-adjustable brass valves ensure precision flame control. The 15,000 BTU ceramic rear infrared burner coupled with the heavy-duty rotisserie motor ensure smooth turning and consistent heating for perfectly rotissed foods. The stainless steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean, and the dual-position warming rack lifts up and out of the way when not in use for additional workspace. Providing protection from the elements and helping maintain the beauty of your grill, the control panel is recessed, keeping chrome knobs and switches out of the way. Experience more comfortable grilling with the unique Artisan air curtain chimney design, keeping controls cool to the touch, even with lid closed. For added visibility when grilling in low-light conditions, the Professional grills feature a convenient interior halogen work light with removable lens for easy maintenance. The matching 304 stainless steel cart features two side shelves, spacious dual access door storage, and locking caster wheels for easy mobility.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Made in the USA from 304 stainless steel, the 36-Inch AAEP-36C-LP freestanding propane gas grill features a seamless welded double-walled hood for exceptional heat retention, as well as a full length handle and an easy-open spring-assisted system. Three stainless steel tube U-burners each produce 20,000 BTUs, which evenly distribute high heat across the cooking surface.

Made in the USA from 304 stainless steel, the 42-Inch ARTP-42C-LP freestanding propane gas grill features a seamless welded double-walled hood for exceptional heat retention, as well as a full length handle and an easy-open spring-assisted system. Three stainless steel tube U-burners each produce 20,000 BTUs, which evenly distribute high heat across the cooking surface. Electrical wires and connectors are also encapsulated with heat-resistant silicone, making the 110v electrical ignition system fast and reliable, while fully-adjustable brass valves ensure precision flame control. The 15,000 BTU ceramic rear infrared burner coupled with the heavy-duty rotisserie motor ensure smooth turning and consistent heating for perfectly spit-roasted foods. The stainless steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean, and the dual-position warming rack lifts up and out of the way when not in use for additional workspace. Providing protection from the elements and helping maintain the beauty of your grill, the control panel is recessed, keeping chrome knobs and switches out of the way. Experience more comfortable grilling with the unique Artisan air curtain chimney design, keeping controls cool to the touch, even with lid closed. For added visibility when grilling in low-light conditions, the Professional grills feature a convenient interior halogen work light with removable lens for easy maintenance. The matching 304 stainless steel cart features two side shelves, spacious dual access door storage, and locking caster wheels for easy mobility.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Made in the USA from 304 stainless steel, the 32-Inch AAEP-32C-NG freestanding natural gas grill features a seamless welded double-walled hood for exceptional heat retention, as well as a full length handle and an easy-open spring-assisted system. Three stainless steel tube U-burners each produce 20,000 BTUs, which evenly distribute high heat across the cooking surface. Electrical wires and connectors are encapsulated with heat-resistant silicone, making the 9v electrical ignition system fast and reliable, while the fully-adjustable brass valves ensure precision flame control. The stainless steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean, and the dual-position warming rack lifts up and out of the way when not in use for additional workspace. Providing protection from the elements and helping maintain the beauty of your grill, the control panel is recessed, keeping chrome knobs and switches out of the way. Experience more comfortable grilling with the unique Artisan air curtain chimney design, which keeps controls cool to the touch, even with lid closed. A built-in hood thermometer displays accurate temperatures for easy oven roasting. The matching 304 stainless steel cart features two side shelves, spacious dual access door storage, and locking caster wheels for easy mobility.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Made in the USA from 304 stainless steel, the 32-Inch AAEP-32C-LP freestanding propane gas grill features a seamless welded double-walled hood for exceptional heat retention, as well as a full length handle and an easy-open spring-assisted system. Three stainless steel tube U-burners each produce 20,000 BTUs, which evenly distribute high heat across the cooking surface.

Made in the USA from 304 stainless steel, the 36-Inch AAEP-36C-NG freestanding natural gas grill features a seamless welded double-walled hood for exceptional heat retention, as well as a full length handle and an easy-open spring-assisted system. Three stainless steel tube U-burners each produce 20,000 BTUs, which evenly distribute high heat across the cooking surface.
