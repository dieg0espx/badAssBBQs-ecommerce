The chimney cap also features a hood to keep out rain for all-weather grilling. Newly designed for 2021, the easy lift-and-lock hinge system keeps the lid raised in place, now requiring 70-percent less force to open than previous models. A soft-close felt gasket protects the ceramic while opening and closing the lid using the newly designed cool touch handle, now featuring integrated retaining clips to help keep the ceramic top firmly in place.

The Primo Oval Junior Smoker Charcoal Grill is a medium to large size grill with all the benefits of the original, uniquely shaped Oval XL, but for those who do not need as much cooking area. The distinct shape of the Oval Junior allows you to cook using direct or indirect heat, expanding your grilling options unlike any other kamado-style grill. This grill features easy to clean and reversible stainless steel cooking grates, as well as one of the highest sitting lids on the market which is great for cooking whole chickens. This kamado style grill is made in the USA, unlike its competition, constructed with premium grade Primo SuperCeramics, and coated with a protective, lead-free, and scratch-resistant porcelain glaze. The patented Primo Oval Junior efficiently retains and evenly distributes heat across the 210 square inches of cooking surface, perfect for maintaining a consistent temperature. Smoke meat at temperatures as low as 180 degrees Fahrenheit, or turn up the heat to more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit for searing and grilling. Use the 6-position cast aluminum chimney cap, 5-position stainless steel lower vent door, and easy to read thermometer for monitoring and keeping a precise temperature. The chimney cap also features a hood to keep out rain for all-weather grilling. Newly designed for 2021, the easy lift-and-lock hinge system keeps the lid raised in place, now requiring 70-percent less force to open than previous models. A soft-close felt gasket protects the ceramic while opening and closing the lid using the newly designed cool touch handle, now featuring integrated retaining clips to help keep the ceramic top firmly in place. The included ceramic feet safely elevate your grill away from the combustible surface of the table, which is constructed by hand from durable cypress wood. The compact design of the cypress table gives you the convenience of a movable table without taking up much space, while tastefully showcasing your Primo grill. Four revolving and lockable caster wheels roll smoothly on any patio surface and lock in place when you are ready to grill. The variety of accessories available, along with the unique oval shape, allows flexibility in cooking a never ending list of delicious meals. Choosing a Primo kamado style grill is a decision you will never regret.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The distinct shape of the Primo All-In-One Oval Large Ceramic Kamado Grill With Cradle & Side Shelves allows you to cook using direct or indirect heat, expanding your grilling options unlike any other kamado-style grill. This grill features easy to clean and reversible stainless steel cooking grates, as well as one of the highest sitting lids which is great for cooking whole chickens or turkeys. This kamado style grill is made in the USA, unlike its competition, and constructed with premium grade Primo SuperCeramics and coated with a protective, lead-free, and scratch-resistant porcelain glaze. The patented Primo Oval Large efficiently retains and evenly distributes heat across the 300 square inches of cooking surface, perfect for maintaining a consistent temperature. Smoke meat at temperatures as low as 180 degrees Fahrenheit, or turn up the heat to more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit for searing and grilling. Use the 6-position cast aluminum chimney cap, 5-position stainless steel lower vent door, and easy to read thermometer for monitoring and keeping a precise temperature. The chimney cap also features a hood to keep out rain for all-weather grilling. Newly designed for 2021, the easy lift-and-lock hinge system keeps the lid raised in place, now requiring 70-percent less force to open than previous models. A soft-close felt gasket protects the ceramic while opening and closing the lid using the newly designed cool touch handle, now featuring integrated retaining clips to help keep the ceramic top firmly in place. Heat-safe ceramic feet are available to stabilize your Primo and are needed when the grill sits on a combustible surface (sold separately). The variety of accessories available, along with the unique oval shape, allows flexibility in cooking a never ending list of delicious meals. Choosing a Primo kamado style grill is a decision you will never regret. The sturdy metal cradle securely holds your Primo Oval Large Ceramic Kamado Grill and is the ideal cart for a small yard or patio. Four revolving wheels help you move it around with ease, and two wheels can be locked for stability while grilling. Side shelves made with FDA approved material for food contact, ash tool and grill lifter are all included in this package.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
