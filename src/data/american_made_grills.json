Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class.  3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner  The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler!  In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie.  Stainless Steel Construction  Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting  You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Stainless Steel Grill Cart with Storage  Talk about grilling convenience! The Estate 30\" Grill Cart features double access doors with storage space, ventilation, and locking caster wheels. It arrives fully assembled. Rotisserie Spit Storage  Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet!

The 36\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 110,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,000 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of propane, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.  Super-cool Design Reminiscent of a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT 350 You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car.  In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.  Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners, 12-gauge burner covers, reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates, and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark.  Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Stainless Steel Grill Cart with Ample StorageTalk about grilling convenience! The Encore 36\" Hybrid Propane Grill Cart features soft-close drawers, including a large drawer to store charcoal and wood, a propane tank storage drawer, a folding shelf with a cutting board, a towel holder, locking and non-locking caster wheels, and it arrives fully assembled. Rotisserie Spit Storage Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet! It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.  Included Accessories - a $1,200+ Value! Each American Made Grill Encore Hybrid grill comes with:  Rotisserie Kit Heavy Duty PVC Grill Cover Grate Lifting Tools Stainless Steel Griddle Drop-in Infrared Sear Burner Leather Gloves Fuel Kit (wood & charcoal) Care Kit Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The 54\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 176,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,600 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of propane, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.  Super-cool Design Reminiscent of a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT 350 You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car.  In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 36\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.  Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners, 12-gauge burner covers, reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates, and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark.  Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Stainless Steel Grill Cart with Ample StorageTalk about grilling convenience! The Encore 54\" Hybrid Propane Grill Cart features soft-close drawers, including a large drawer to store charcoal and wood, a propane tank storage drawer, a folding shelf with a cutting board, a towel holder, locking and non-locking caster wheels, and it arrives fully assembled. Rotisserie Spit Storage Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet! It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.  Included Accessories - a $1,500+ Value! Each American Made Grill Encore Hybrid grill comes with:  Rotisserie Kit Heavy Duty PVC Grill Cover Grate Lifting Tools Stainless Steel Griddle Drop-in Infrared Sear Burner Leather Gloves Fuel Kit (wood & charcoal) Care Kit Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The 54\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 176,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,600 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of natural gas, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.  Super-cool Design Reminiscent of a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT 350 You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car.  In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 36\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.  Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners, 12-gauge burner covers, reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates, and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark.  Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Stainless Steel Grill Cart with Ample StorageTalk about grilling convenience! The Encore 54\" Hybrid Natural Gas Grill Cart features soft-close drawers, including a large drawer to store charcoal and wood, a tank storage drawer, a folding shelf with a cutting board, a towel holder, locking and non-locking caster wheels, and it arrives fully assembled. Rotisserie Spit Storage Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet!

The 36\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 110,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,000 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of natural gas, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.  Super-cool Design Reminiscent of a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT 350 You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car.  In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.  Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners, 12-gauge burner covers, reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates, and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark.  Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Rotisserie Spit Storage Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet! It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.  Included Accessories - a $1,200+ Value! Each American Made Grill Encore Hybrid grill comes with:  Rotisserie Kit Heavy Duty PVC Grill Cover Grate Lifting Tools Stainless Steel Griddle Drop-in Infrared Sear Burner Leather Gloves Fuel Kit (wood & charcoal) Care Kit Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of natural gas, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.

There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.

The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches.

In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie.  Stainless Steel Construction  Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.

The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.

The 54\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 176,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,600 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of propane, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.

There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.

Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class.  3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner  The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler!  In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie.  Stainless Steel Construction  Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting  You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Rotisserie Spit Storage  Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet!  It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.  Included Accessories - a $1,000+ Value!

The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.

The 36\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 110,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,000 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of propane, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.

There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.

The 54\" Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 176,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,600 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories.  Hybrid Multi-Fuel Capability Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of natural gas, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.  Super-cool Design Reminiscent of a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT 350 You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car.  In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.  Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners, 12-gauge burner covers, reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates, and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark.  Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.  Rotisserie Spit Storage Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included.  Made in the USA? You bet! It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.  Included Accessories - a $1,400+ Value! Each American Made Grill Encore Hybrid grill comes with:  Rotisserie Kit Heavy Duty PVC Grill Cover Grate Lifting Tools Stainless Steel Griddle Drop-in Infrared Sear Burner Leather Gloves Fuel Kit (wood & charcoal) Care Kit Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of natural gas, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism.  Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners, 12-gauge burner covers, reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates, and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark.  Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.

Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class.  3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner  The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches.

In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie.  Stainless Steel Construction  Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting  You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.

Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class.  3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner  The Estate propane grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler!  In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie.  Stainless Steel Construction  Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service.  Blue Knob Lighting  You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.

The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day.  Interior Halogen Lighting  Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.
