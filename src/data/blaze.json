    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Blaze LTE+ Collection adds industry-leading feature updates to the best-selling LTE lineNew design makes metal knobs shine red when on, indicating that gas is flowing. Knobs are also scored for added durability and grip.Updated internal lighting system makes for a more enjoyable grilling experienceSpring assisted hood makes opening and closing easier than everConvenient magnetic latch automatically turns on interior lights when hood is openThe Blaze Premium LTE+ natural gas grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.Effortless by DesignThe Blaze Premium LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for 70,000 BTUs.Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze Premium LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesA modern, eye-pleasing pizza oven that does restaurant-quality pizza and so much moreGet an even bake with its 17 inch rotating ceramic pizza stoneVertical rotisserie rod w/ drip tray & 2 cooking racks for many food options in addition to pizzaA digital screen with connected meat probes for the most accurate cooking timesInterior lighting and double-pane glass oven doors to prevent heat lossThe Blaze Built-in Natural Gas Pizza Oven completes your outdoor kitchen and instantly enhances your living space with its sleek design. The cutout dimensions are 24 2/5\" W x 24 1/5\" D x 8\" H. If your outdoor island is constructed of combustible materials, an insulated jacket is required.  Stylish Stainless Steel Construction  The Blaze Pizza Oven, constructed of 304 stainless steel, is durable, resistant to corrosion, and easy to clean. Pleasing to the eye and practical, it can handle a variety of cooking needs now and for years to come.  Vertical Rotisserie for Cooking Versatility  Deep-dish, flatbread, or any other style of pizza, this pizza oven is, of course, up to any pizza cooking challenge you throw at it, but with a built-in rotisserie rod and double cooking racks, you'll just as easily prepare a sumptuous rack of lamb as a delicious personal pie. After all the Blaze Pizza Oven is designed to be, well, an oven, which means you can cook just about anything on it \u2014 steaks, cookies, lasagna \u2014 you name it.  360-Degree Rotating Pizza Stone  Forget about having to stick your arm into a piping hot oven to twirl your pizza. The 17\" ceramic pizza stone rotates at the push of a button, so your family pizza night can truly incorporate the kids. Plus, by evenly distributing the heat from the oven (and eliminating any annoying cold spots), the stone will both ensure total pizza perfection and provide an excellent surface to cook so many other dishes.  From Low-and-Slow to Searing Heat  Tubular burners offer the capability to cook low and slow at 270 degrees or rip as high as 550 degrees while using the dual cooking racks. That's the kind of oven temperature range that allows for true cooking versatility. And because the pizza stone is heated directly at the burners, its surface can reach 700 degrees, which means crispy, restaurant-quality pizza in mere minutes or any other foods that require serious heat.   Three Configuration Options to Suit Your Setup  In addition to the Built-in model, the Blaze Pizza Oven is also available in Countertop and Freestanding configurations. Compatible with Propane or Natural Gas  The Blaze pizza oven includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit. The Blaze Lifetime Warranty  Enjoy pizza and peace of mind with a lifetime warranty. Enough said.

Grill with confidence behind the power of 4 commercial-grade, 16-gauge stainless steel tube burners that deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs of cooking performance each (for a total of 56,000 BTUs). The 8mm stainless steel cooking rods enhance searing capability on a spacious 715 square inches of cooking area, more than enough to feed a crowd of hungry guests. Plus, Blazes Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures a reliable start every time; in the unlikely event it fails, the backup flash tube ignition and crossover channels step up to light the burners so you can grill on.Comes with 2 Tasty Sides: Cooking Versatility & Incredible WarrantiesOn other grills, cooking more than one item at a time can be a struggle. That's not the case for the Blaze Prelude LBM, which includes heat zone separators that help you create varying levels of heat with each burner. Sear on one side, slow roast on the other, and do everything in between to make sure your guests leave satisfied. As far as warranties go, it's hard to beat Blazes usual best-in-class, lifetime warranty but that didn't stop them from tacking on a 3-year, multi-user warranty that covers commercial settings like apartment complexes and condos.CSA Certified to the following Standard:CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

This strongly built, 42 deep vent hood is designed to keep your outdoor kitchen as free of smoke as possible with a pair of individually controlled, 1,000-CFM internal blowers. With 4 speed settings to manage the smoke intake, you can run the hood right where it's needed every time.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best in class Lifetime warrantyEfficient design brings water to a boil in half the time compared to other power burners on the marketNarrow width allows more room in your outdoor kitchen for another component or even just more counter spaceRed LED lights above control knobs make nighttime cooking easierCast stainless steel dual ring burner with independent controls for flexible heat controlIntroducing an affordable power burner that incorporates a narrow footprint and an efficient design which boils water in half the time as other power burners on the market. At 15 3/4 inches wide, the Blaze Premium LTE Power Burner gives you more room for additional components or more counter space for prepping and other tasks. Blaze power burners are made from stainless steel and include a removable stainless steel lid to protect the burner when not in use. The cooking grid is constructed from heavy-duty stainless steel rods with a removable 9-inch inner ring for cooking with a wok. Underneath the grid, a stainless steel guard surrounds the burner, which protects it from the wind and concentrates heat for maximum efficiency. This natural gas power burner features two, individually controllable burner rings. The inner ring is rated for 25,000 BTUs, and the outer ring is rated for 35,000 BTUs. The burners are lit with a simple push and turn ignition. This dual ring design is ideal for cooking versatility. The inner burner is great for simmering sauces, or use both burners when boiling shrimp or frying fish. Cooking with the outer ring is perfect for large skillets and pans, as the high heat allows the pan to heat up quickly. The burner ring is made from commercial quality, 304 cast stainless steel for longevity. This power burner also sports red LED control knob illumination for cooking and entertaining at night. If you are looking for an affordable power burner so you have more in your budget for other components, Blaze power burners are a great solution. A power transformer is included for the lights.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best-in-class Lifetime warrantyPatented Triangle-shaped Searing Rods create an ideal surface for cooking and produce impressive sear marksHeat zone separators allow you to cook multiple types of food at the same time using different temperatures like an expert chefFull-width, 14-gauge stainless steel Flame Tamers cover the entire grilling area to improve flavor, minimize flare-ups, and reduce cold spotsCast stainless steel Linear Burners for durability and longevityDesigned to Last: Commercial-Grade Stainless Steel, Double-Lined Hood, & MoreBlaze was built on the idea of high quality at an affordable price. Naturally, unrivaled durability makes this Blaze grill a favorite among outdoor chefs seeking a premium experience. Made of cast 304-grade stainless steel with no vulnerable weld spots, the Blaze Premium LTE propane grill is engineered for whatever challenges the elements (or your menu) can throw at it. The stainless steel grill hood, meanwhile, is double-lined to insulate and protect the outer layer from heat discoloration, resulting in a grill that looks like new no matter how many times you've put it to work. And if Blaze's craftsmanship doesn't inspire confidence, its best-in-class lifetime warranty will.Designed to Perform: Reliable Ignition & Flame TamersFrom startup to sizzle, every aspect of the Blaze Premium LTE grill is optimized for top-level performance. Look no further than the ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, which features a Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels system to ensure a steady flame with every start. Blaze's flame-tamer system is just as dependable: it keeps flare-ups in check, helps heat reach every corner of the grilling surface, and instantly vaporizes food drippings into delicious wisps of smoke. With no fear of flare-ups and hot and cold spots a thing of the past, you're free to enjoy grilling in its finest form. Throw in 14,000 BTUs of cooking power from each of the 4 cast stainless steel Linear burners along with patented triangle-shaped Searing Rods, and you've got a workhorse grill ready to meet every challenge head-on.Designed to Impress: LED Grill Knobs & Premium FeaturesIt all starts with the first thing that catches most eyes: the LED-illuminated grill knobs, with distinctive red led lights that help create a sophisticated look, especially in the evening. Between the LED knobs and the internal halogen lights illuminating the grill surface at night, you'll be empowered to entertain - no - enchant well past dark. The finer details also wow, from the incredibly useful warming rack to the removable, full-width drip tray for easy cleanup.Can also be purchased in natural gas based on the customer's fuel needs.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best in class Lifetime warrantyEfficient design brings water to a boil in half the time compared to other power burners on the marketNarrow width allows more room in your outdoor kitchen for another component or even just more counter spaceCast stainless steel dual ring burner with independent controls for flexible heat controlRed LED illuminated control knobs for cooking and entertaining at nightIntroducing an affordable power burner that incorporates a narrow footprint and an efficient design which boils water in half the time as other power burners on the market. At 15 3/4 inches wide, the Blaze Professional LUX Power Burner gives you more room for additional components or more counter space for prepping and other tasks. Blaze power burners are made from stainless steel and include a removable stainless steel lid to protect the burner when not in use. The cooking grid is constructed from heavy-duty stainless steel rods with a removable 9-inch inner ring for cooking with a wok. Underneath the grid, a stainless steel guard surrounds the burner, which protects it from the wind and concentrates heat for maximum efficiency. This natural gas power burner features two, individually controllable burner rings. The inner ring is rated for 25,000 BTUs, and the outer ring is rated for 35,000 BTUs. The burners are lit with a simple push and turn ignition. This dual ring design is ideal for cooking versatility. The inner burner is great for simmering sauces, or use both burners when boiling shrimp or frying fish. Cooking with the outer ring is perfect for large skillets and pans, as the high heat allows the pan to heat up quickly. The burner ring is made from commercial quality, 304 cast stainless steel for longevity. This power burner also sports red LED control knob illumination for cooking and entertaining at night. If you are looking for an affordable power burner so you have more in your budget for other components, Blaze power burners are a great solution. A power transformer is included for the lights.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill \"professional\" if they didn't mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 3-burner natural gas grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its three 304 cast stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-upsAbove the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this built-in Blaze natural gas grill has all the makings of a luxury experience. Easy to Fire Up and AdjustStartup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time. Yes, Luxury Grilling is an Actual ThingEvery aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX built-in 3-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.Sophisticated Design Meets PracticalityWhen it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 615 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry.

This strongly built 48-inch deep vent hood is designed to keep your outdoor kitchen as free of smoke as possible with two independent and individually controlled 1,000-CFM internal blowers. With 4 speed settings to manage the smoke intake, you can run the hood right where it's needed every time.

Plus, to top it off, the baffles are dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning.Upgraded FeaturesThat kind of performance does much more than keep your outdoor kitchen free of smoke. Because the Blaze 48-inch vent hood is deeper and more powerful than even the 42-inch model, it can be installed much higher than other grill hoods, making your outdoor area much more spacious. And when the cookout continues past sundown, the vent's set of 4 LED lights with adjustable brightness settings illuminate your grill grates so you can finish the job.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Blaze LTE+ Collection adds industry-leading feature updates to the best-selling LTE lineNew design makes metal knobs shine red when on, indicating that gas is flowing. Knobs are also scored for added durability and grip.Updated internal lighting system makes for a more enjoyable grilling experienceSpring assisted hood makes opening and closing easier than everConvenient magnetic latch automatically turns on interior lights when hood is openThe Blaze Premium LTE+ propane grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.Effortless by DesignThe Blaze Premium LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for 70,000 BTUs.Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze Premium LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesA modern, eye-pleasing pizza oven that does restaurant-quality pizza and so much moreGet an even bake with its 17 inch rotating ceramic pizza stoneVertical rotisserie rod w/ drip tray & 2 cooking racks for many food options in addition to pizzaA digital screen with connected meat probes for the most accurate cooking timesInterior lighting and double-pane glass oven doors to prevent heat lossThe Blaze Freestanding Propane Pizza Oven gives you the freedom to locate it where it's most convenient, and to move it around when necessary.  Stylish Stainless Steel Construction The Blaze Pizza Oven, constructed of 304 stainless steel, is durable, resistant to corrosion, and easy to clean. Pleasing to the eye and practical, it can handle a variety of cooking needs now and for years to come. Vertical Rotisserie for Cooking Versatility Deep-dish, flatbread, or any other style of pizza, this pizza oven is, of course, up to any pizza cooking challenge you throw at it, but with a built-in rotisserie rod and double cooking racks, you'll just as easily prepare a sumptuous rack of lamb as a delicious personal pie. After all the Blaze Pizza Oven is designed to be, well, an oven, which means you can cook just about anything on it \u2014 steaks, cookies, lasagna \u2014 you name it. 360-Degree Rotating Pizza Stone  Forget about having to stick your arm into a piping hot oven to twirl your pizza. The 17\" ceramic pizza stone rotates at the push of a button, so your family pizza night can truly incorporate the kids. Plus, by evenly distributing the heat from the oven (and eliminating any annoying cold spots), the stone will both ensure total pizza perfection and provide an excellent surface to cook so many other dishes.  From Low-and-Slow to Searing Heat  Tubular burners offer the capability to cook low and slow at 270 degrees or rip as high as 550 degrees while using the dual cooking racks. That's the kind of oven temperature range that allows for true cooking versatility. And because the pizza stone is heated directly at the burners, its surface can reach 700 degrees, which means crispy, restaurant-quality pizza in mere minutes or any other foods that require serious heat.   Three Configuration Options to Suite Your Setup  In addition to the Freestanding model, the Blaze Pizza Oven is also available in Countertop and Built-in configurations. Compatible with Propane or Natural Gas  The Blaze pizza oven includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit. The Blaze Lifetime Warranty  Enjoy pizza and peace of mind with a lifetime warranty. Enough said.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesA modern, eye-pleasing pizza oven that does restaurant-quality pizza and so much moreGet an even bake with its 17 inch rotating ceramic pizza stoneVertical rotisserie rod w/ drip tray & 2 cooking racks for many food options in addition to pizzaA digital screen with connected meat probes for the most accurate cooking timesInterior lighting and double-pane glass oven doors to prevent heat lossThe Blaze Built-in Propane Pizza Oven completes your outdoor kitchen and instantly enhances your living space with its sleek design. The cutout dimensions are 24 2/5\" W x 24 1/5\" D x 8\" H. If your outdoor island is constructed of combustible materials, an insulated jacket is required.  Stylish Stainless Steel Construction  The Blaze Pizza Oven, constructed of 304 stainless steel, is durable, resistant to corrosion, and easy to clean. Pleasing to the eye and practical, it can handle a variety of cooking needs now and for years to come.  Vertical Rotisserie for Cooking Versatility  Deep-dish, flatbread, or any other style of pizza, this pizza oven is, of course, up to any pizza cooking challenge you throw at it, but with a built-in rotisserie rod and double cooking racks, you'll just as easily prepare a sumptuous rack of lamb as a delicious personal pie. After all the Blaze Pizza Oven is designed to be, well, an oven, which means you can cook just about anything on it \u2014 steaks, cookies, lasagna \u2014 you name it.  360-Degree Rotating Pizza Stone  Forget about having to stick your arm into a piping hot oven to twirl your pizza. The 17\" ceramic pizza stone rotates at the push of a button, so your family pizza night can truly incorporate the kids. Plus, by evenly distributing the heat from the oven (and eliminating any annoying cold spots), the stone will both ensure total pizza perfection and provide an excellent surface to cook so many other dishes.  From Low-and-Slow to Searing Heat  Tubular burners offer the capability to cook low and slow at 270 degrees or rip as high as 550 degrees while using the dual cooking racks. That's the kind of oven temperature range that allows for true cooking versatility. And because the pizza stone is heated directly at the burners, its surface can reach 700 degrees, which means crispy, restaurant-quality pizza in mere minutes or any other foods that require serious heat.   Three Configuration Options to Suit Your Setup  In addition to the Built-in model, the Blaze Pizza Oven is also available in Countertop and Freestanding configurations. Compatible with Propane or Natural Gas  The Blaze pizza oven includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit. The Blaze Lifetime Warranty  Enjoy pizza and peace of mind with a lifetime warranty. Enough said.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best-in-class Lifetime warrantyPatented Triangle-shaped Searing Rods create an ideal surface for cooking and produce impressive sear marksHeat zone separators allow you to cook multiple types of food at the same time using different temperaturesFull-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers cover the entire grilling area to improve flavor, minimize flare-ups, and reduce cold spotsCast stainless steel Linear Burners for durability and longevityDesigned to Last: Commercial-Grade Stainless Steel, Double-Lined Hood, & MoreBlaze was built on the idea of high quality at an affordable price. Naturally, unrivaled durability makes this Blaze grill a favorite among outdoor chefs seeking a premium experience. Made of cast 304-grade stainless steel with no vulnerable weld spots, the Blaze Premium LTE natural gas grill is engineered for whatever challenges the elements (or your menu) can throw at it. The stainless steel grill hood, meanwhile, is double-lined to insulate and protect the outer layer from heat discoloration, resulting in a grill that looks like new no matter how many times you've put it to work. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. And if Blaze's craftsmanship doesn't inspire confidence, its best-in-class lifetime warranty will.Designed to Perform: Reliable Ignition & Flame TamersFrom startup to sizzle, every aspect of the Blaze Premium LTE grill is optimized for top-level performance. Look no further than the ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, which features a Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels system to ensure a steady flame with every start. Blaze's flame-tamer system is just as dependable: it keeps flare-ups in check, helps heat reach every corner of the grilling surface, and instantly vaporizes food drippings into delicious wisps of smoke. With no fear of flare-ups and hot and cold spots a thing of the past, you're free to enjoy grilling in its finest form. Throw in 14,000 BTUs of cooking power from each of the 4 cast stainless steel Linear burners along with patented triangle-shaped Searing Rods, and you've got a workhorse grill ready to meet every challenge head-on.Designed to Impress: LED Grill Knobs & Premium FeaturesIt all starts with the first thing that catches most eyes: the LED-illuminated grill knobs, with distinctive red led lights that help create a sophisticated look, especially in the evening. Between the LED knobs and the internal halogen lights illuminating the grill surface at night, you'll be empowered to entertain - no - enchant well past dark. The finer details also wow, from the incredibly useful warming rack to the removable, full-width drip tray for easy cleanup.Can also be purchased in propane based on the customer's fuel needs.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best-in-class Lifetime warranty on partsPatented Triangle-shaped Searing Rods create an ideal surface for cooking and produce impressive sear marksHeat zone separators allow you to cook multiple types of food at the same time using different temperatures like an expert chefFull-width, 14-gauge stainless steel Flame Tamers cover the entire grilling area to improve flavor, minimize flare-ups, and reduce cold spotsCast stainless steel Linear Burners for durability and longevityDesigned to Last: Commercial-Grade Stainless Steel, Double-Lined Hood, & MoreBlaze was built on the idea of high quality at an affordable price. Naturally, unrivaled durability makes this Blaze grill a favorite among outdoor chefs seeking a premium experience. Made of cast 304-grade stainless steel with no vulnerable weld spots, the Blaze Premium LTE propane grill is engineered for whatever challenges the elements (or your menu) can throw at it. The stainless steel grill hood, meanwhile, is double-lined to insulate and protect the outer layer from heat discoloration, resulting in a grill that looks like new no matter how many times you've put it to work. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your propane tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. And if Blaze's craftsmanship doesn't inspire confidence, its best-in-class lifetime warranty will.Designed to Perform: Reliable Ignition & Flame TamersFrom startup to sizzle, every aspect of the Blaze Premium LTE grill is optimized for top-level performance. Look no further than the ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, which features a Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels system to ensure a steady flame with every start. Blaze's flame-tamer system is just as dependable: it keeps flare-ups in check, helps heat reach every corner of the grilling surface, and instantly vaporizes food drippings into delicious wisps of smoke. With no fear of flare-ups and hot and cold spots a thing of the past, you're free to enjoy grilling in its finest form. Throw in 14,000 BTUs of cooking power from each of the 4 cast stainless steel Linear burners along with patented triangle-shaped Searing Rods, and you've got a workhorse grill ready to meet every challenge head-on.Designed to Impress: LED Grill Knobs & Premium FeaturesIt all starts with the first thing that catches most eyes: the LED-illuminated grill knobs, with distinctive red led lights that help create a sophisticated look, especially in the evening. Between the LED knobs and the internal halogen lights illuminating the grill surface at night, you'll be empowered to entertain - no - enchant well past dark. The finer details also wow, from the incredibly useful warming rack to the removable, full-width drip tray for easy cleanup.Can also be purchased in natural gas based on the customer's fuel needs. Please note that a 110V power source is required.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesExtra deep design allows the hood to cover more grilling areaA high performance 1000 CFM 4-speed blower clears your patio of smokeCommercial style baffles help prevent grease from entering duct workExtreme performance allows the hood to be installed higher above the grillControls have LED lighting to make it easier to see and adjust settingsExtra deep and high capacity design ensures the Blaze outdoor vent hood can handle any amount of grilling day or night. One internal 1000 CFM blower with four speed settings manages the smoke intake. Blaze vent hoods are perfect for the customer who wants to do the best they can to ensure their outdoor living space is as clear of smoke as possible. The 36-inch depth allows the hood to better cover the grill and capture more grease and smoke. Most vent hoods require an extra piece to extend the hood further to the front of the grill, while the Blaze vent hood is stronger and deeper to cover that area. The same powerful design also allows you to install the vent hood at a higher position above the cooking surface to allow more headroom. The motor can be configured to vent horizontally out the back of the hood or vertically, which allows you to install the vent hood to suit your specific needs. Two individual lights can be adjusted to four brightness settings and, combined with the depth, help better illuminate the cooking surface compared to a standard depth vent hood. Six, commercial-style baffle filters help prevent grease from entering the duct work and are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Constructed of 304 grade stainless steel, this vent hood with a rounded canopy will withstand the outdoor elements and match all components of your outdoor kitchen. The extreme performance and sleek design is the perfect complement for almost any outdoor BBQ grill.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best in class Lifetime warrantyEfficient design brings water to a boil in half the time compared to other power burners on the marketNarrow width allows more room in your outdoor kitchen for another component or even just more counter spaceRed LED lights above control knobs make nighttime cooking easierCast stainless steel dual ring burner with independent controls for flexible heat controlIntroducing an affordable power burner that incorporates a narrow footprint and an efficient design which boils water in half the time as other power burners on the market. At 15 3/4 inches wide, the Blaze Premium LTE Power Burner gives you more room for additional components or more counter space for prepping and other tasks. Blaze power burners are made from stainless steel and include a removable stainless steel lid to protect the burner when not in use. The cooking grid is constructed from heavy-duty stainless steel rods with a removable 9-inch inner ring for cooking with a wok. Underneath the grid, a stainless steel guard surrounds the burner, which protects it from the wind and concentrates heat for maximum efficiency. This propane gas power burner features two, individually controllable burner rings. The inner ring is rated for 25,000 BTUs, and the outer ring is rated for 35,000 BTUs. The burners are lit with a simple push and turn ignition. This dual ring design is ideal for cooking versatility. The inner burner is great for simmering sauces, or use both burners when boiling shrimp or frying fish. Cooking with the outer ring is perfect for large skillets and pans, as the high heat allows the pan to heat up quickly. The burner ring is made from commercial quality, 304 cast stainless steel for longevity. This power burner also sports red LED control knob illumination for cooking and entertaining at night. If you are looking for an affordable power burner so you have more in your budget for other components, Blaze power burners are a great solution. A power transformer is included for the lights.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesGet it for the price, keep it for its best-in-class, lifetime warrantyTake pride in beautiful sear marks produced by patented triangle-shaped searing rodsGrill like a pro with heat zone separators that let you harness multiple cooking styles at onceCast stainless steel Linear burners deliver years of premium grilling powerStainless steel flame tamers reduce flare-ups for a worry-free grilling experienceHighly Durable: 304-Grade Stainless SteelAffordable quality is the Blaze calling card, and the Premium LTE propane grill might be the best example yet. Made of 304-grade stainless steel with no vulnerable weld spots, this grill is built like a fortress to repel even the worst outdoor elements over years of use. The stainless steel grill hood, meanwhile, features a double lining that fittingly serves dual purposes: protecting the outer layer from heat discoloration, and trapping heat in the firebox for more intense searing temperatures. A grill this strong is good for years upon years of BBQs; are you up for the same challenge? High Performance: Fewer Hot/Cold Spots, Beautiful Sear Marks, & MoreSay goodbye to the days of grilling headaches - the Blaze Premium LTE makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, which is a breeze thanks to the Blaze Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for a grand total of 70,000 BTUs.In another huge win for performance, Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE built-in grill with patented triangular Searing Rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up massive amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots!Highly Convenient: Features to Fall ForThe most notable features on this Blaze gas grill are designed to be seen. Internal halogen lights give you a clear view of the grilling area when the BBQ lasts past sundown, while the red LED Illuminated Control System helps you monitor burner levels in the dark while adding a subdued hint of style. A removable warming rack sits inside the grill to keep cooked items hot, toast buns, or just provide a bit more grilling space when you are feeding a crowd. And cleanup? It does not get any easier than a removable, full-width drip tray on soft rollers. Now that is what we call premium!CSA Certified to the following Standard: CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesUnbeatable combination of durability and affordability yields high-quality grillingBlaze offers a best-in-class, lifetime warranty to give you ultimate peace of mindTop-of-the-line durability thanks to solid cast aluminum constructionExcellent heat, smoke, and moisture retention due to its tongue-and-groove seal304-grade stainless steel, spring-assisted hinge makes opening the lid easyCan a Kamado Grill Be Indestructible? Spoiler Alert: Yes Simply put, the Blaze Kamado offers superior durability to ceramic kamados  the traditional material for this grill type  for a lifetime of grilling. How? Its all in the cast aluminum alloys that contain very little iron, which results in a rust-proof design strongly resistant to the elements. And unlike ceramic, cast aluminum allows you to use any type of charcoal, wood, or lighting materials without the worry of it causing damage or being absorbed into the grill body. Oh, theres more: you wont need to shell out extra money to replace the top exhaust cap, a commonly faulty component on ceramic kamados. Everything comes together to create the most durable kamado on the market. Maximum Heat Retention for Maximum Flavor Being virtually indestructible is one thing, but we know you care about cooking power most of all. The Blaze Kamado delivers with heavy-duty, 304-grade stainless steel cooking grates that measure 12mm in thickness to retain huge amounts of heat for an excellent sear. By shaping the grates hexagonally, Blaze gives food more surface contact with the cooking surface, in turn producing bolder sear marks for wonderfully caramelized flavor. And instead of using a felt gasket like the competition, this cast aluminum kamado utilizes a tongue-and-groove seal. The design eliminates the need to fix a damaged gasket  another commonly replaced kamado component  and also provides an exceptional seal that prevents precious heat and smoke from escaping mid-cook. More heat and more smoke in the grill mean tastier food on your plate. Easier Grilling & Cleaning That 20 diameter cooking grate we were going on about earlier? Well, its hinged on both sides so you can easily add wood or charcoal without removing food and lifting the entire grate. Blaze also included a mid-level, 18 cooking grate that allows you to cook closer to the fire for more intense heat (its also a good spot to place a drip pan or a heat deflector for indirect cooking).  The Blaze Kamados lid hinge is made from 304-grade stainless steel and features a convenient lift-assist function for easy opening and closing. At the bottom of the firebox, youll find a removable stainless steel ash pan with handles for hassle-free cleanup. A large temperature gauge with markings for smoking, roasting, and searing is mounted in the lid, letting you easily monitor cooking temperatures as you entertain. The grill also includes cast aluminum feet so you can safely stabilize it in your outdoor kitchen island, should you choose to use it off the cart. And as one final show of care, this kamado grill comes with high-heat cooking gloves are for safe handling.  EXTRA! Turn your kamado into a rotisserie with Blazes optional rotisserie kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Blaze power burners are made from stainless steel and include a removable stainless steel lid to protect the burner when not in use. The cooking grid is constructed from heavy-duty stainless steel rods with a removable 9-inch inner ring for cooking with a wok.

The burners are lit with a simple push and turn ignition. This dual ring design is ideal for cooking versatility. The inner burner is great for simmering sauces, or use both burners when boiling shrimp or frying fish.

Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill \"professional\" if they didn't mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 3-burner propane grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its three 304 cast stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-upsAbove the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this built-in Blaze propane grill has all the makings of a luxury experience. Easy to Fire Up and AdjustStartup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time. Yes, Luxury Grilling is an Actual ThingEvery aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX built-in 3-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.Sophisticated Design Meets PracticalityWhen it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 615 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry.

This propane gas power burner features two individually controllable burner rings. The inner ring is rated for 25,000 BTUs, and the outer ring is rated for 35,000 BTUs. The burners are lit with a simple push and turn ignition. This dual ring design is ideal for cooking versatility. The inner burner is great for simmering sauces, or use both burners when boiling shrimp or frying fish. Cooking with the outer ring is perfect for large skillets and pans, as the high heat allows the pan to heat up quickly.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesA modern, eye-pleasing pizza oven that does restaurant-quality pizza and so much moreGet an even bake with its 17 inch rotating ceramic pizza stoneVertical rotisserie rod w/ drip tray & 2 cooking racks for many food options in addition to pizzaA digital screen with connected meat probes for the most accurate cooking timesInterior lighting and double-pane glass oven doors to prevent heat lossThe Blaze Freestanding Natural Gas Pizza Oven gives you the freedom to locate it where it's most convenient, and to move it around when necessary.  Stylish Stainless Steel Construction The Blaze Pizza Oven, constructed of 304 stainless steel, is durable, resistant to corrosion, and easy to clean. Pleasing to the eye and practical, it can handle a variety of cooking needs now and for years to come. Vertical Rotisserie for Cooking Versatility Deep-dish, flatbread, or any other style of pizza, this pizza oven is, of course, up to any pizza cooking challenge you throw at it, but with a built-in rotisserie rod and double cooking racks, you'll just as easily prepare a sumptuous rack of lamb as a delicious personal pie. After all the Blaze Pizza Oven is designed to be, well, an oven, which means you can cook just about anything on it \u2014 steaks, cookies, lasagna \u2014 you name it. 360-Degree Rotating Pizza Stone  Forget about having to stick your arm into a piping hot oven to twirl your pizza. The 17\" ceramic pizza stone rotates at the push of a button, so your family pizza night can truly incorporate the kids. Plus, by evenly distributing the heat from the oven (and eliminating any annoying cold spots), the stone will both ensure total pizza perfection and provide an excellent surface to cook so many other dishes.  From Low-and-Slow to Searing Heat  Tubular burners offer the capability to cook low and slow at 270 degrees or rip as high as 550 degrees while using the dual cooking racks. That's the kind of oven temperature range that allows for true cooking versatility. And because the pizza stone is heated directly at the burners, its surface can reach 700 degrees, which means crispy, restaurant-quality pizza in mere minutes or any other foods that require serious heat.   Three Configuration Options to Suite Your Setup  In addition to the Freestanding model, the Blaze Pizza Oven is also available in Countertop and Built-in configurations. Compatible with Propane or Natural Gas  The Blaze pizza oven includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit. The Blaze Lifetime Warranty  Enjoy pizza and peace of mind with a lifetime warranty. Enough said.

    "Title": "Blaze 6 ft Stainless Steel Outdoor Kitchen Island w/ Premium LTE 32-Inch Natural Gas Grill",
    "Description": "Key FeaturesEasy-to-Assemble BBQ Island paired with a Blaze Premium LTE Natural Gas GrillRust and corrosion resistant 304 stainless steel used for both the island and grillAmple storage space for your grilling tools and more, plus a pull-out trash binBest-in-class Limited Lifetime Warranty on the grill and islandAssembly requires just two things: a Phillips head screwdriver, and a friend!The Blaze BBQ Island with the Blaze Premium LTE natural gas grill is a great way to add an outdoor kitchen to your home with a minimum of hassle, confusion, and hard work. You can literally have your new BBQ Island set up and cooking in a day.Everything Starts with the Blaze 32 4-Burner Premium LTE natural gas GrillYour new Blaze grill is the heartbeat of your BBQ Island. This is one of the best-selling grills in our history - a real workhorse that never disappoints. Crafted of 304 stainless steel, it also has stainless flame tamers and cast stainless steel cooking grates. It's built to last, and it's backed by the aforementioned lifetime warranty. It employs an ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, with a backup Flashtube and Crossover Channel system to ensure a good flame with every start. The flame tamers help keep flame-ups in check, and every inch of the grilling surface gets good and hot. Heat zone separators allow you to cook at different temperatures in each zone, so your asparagus doesn't have to fend for itself when you crank up the flame to sear your ribeyes.The grill includes a rear infrared burner to provide steady, reliable heat to rotisserie (kit sold separately), and an infrared main burner is available as an accessory if you want to establish a super-hot sear zone.The grill includes eye-catching red LED-illuminated grill knobs, plus internal halogen lights to illuminate the cooking surface. A 110-volt power source is required to run the lighting.Easier than Most Do-It-Yourself OptionsUnless you are pumped about surveying, pouring concrete, framing an island or cabinets, applying a stone or brick facing and installing a countertop, a BBQGuys Signature-Blaze Grill Island may be the perfect solution for your outdoor kitchen needs. All components ship together, usually on the same pallet. You're not adding a structure to your home, so you probably won't need a building permit or a contractor. Assembly is usually accomplished in an afternoon. You will need a helper to help you put the panels together and to lift the Blaze built-in gas grill into place, but there's nothing to cut or saw or weld. The kit comes with everything you need to put it together, and the only tool required is a Phillips head screwdriver.Additionally, the island has leveling feet, so the surface doesn't have to be perfectly flat and level. Because it's not permanently attached, you do have the option of setting it up on a deck.Much More Usable Than Just a GrillGive yourself a lot more storage! The center under-the-grill cabinet provides ample room for additional storage. To the left you get a drawer and a pull-out trash bin - which is something most people find indispensable once they have one! On the right are three drawers - with illuminated interiors (AAA batteries required)! The storage doors and drawers are soft close to absorb energy and allow the doors and drawers to close smoothly and silently. This also limits wear and tear on your cabinets. Plus...it's pretty cool.Blaze BBQ Islands are PortableMany people consider this to be a big advantage over a built-in BBQ island: you can move it around if needed. You can rearrange your deck or patio and move your island to accommodate layout changes. Try doing that with your brick island!Take It with You When You Go...or Don't!Because it's not permanently attached to your home, if you move you have the option of disassembling your Blaze BBQ Island and taking it with you to your new home. You also have the option of leaving it in place, and possibly including it in the home sale transaction (check with your real estate agent or attorney to find out how to work that out in your area). Fast, Easy OrderingWith the Blaze BBQ Island, you can order everything you need with a single Add to Cart click. All you do is select whether you want a grill that burns natural gas or propane. It really IS that simple!In most cases, everything will be shipped on a single pallet. You will want to have somebody help you take the boxes from the curb to your garage or backyard, because in total it weighs over 300 lbs. (the grill alone is over 100 lbs.).Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesEasy-to-Assemble BBQ Island paired with a Blaze Premium LTE Propane GrillRust and corrosion resistant 304 stainless steel used for both the island and grillAmple storage space for your grilling tools and more, plus a pull-out trash binBest-in-class Limited Lifetime Warranty on the grill and islandThe Blaze BBQ Island with the Blaze Premium LTE propane grill is a great way to add an outdoor kitchen to your home with a minimum of hassle, confusion, and hard work. You can literally have your new BBQ Island set up and cooking in a day.Everything Starts with the Blaze 32 4-Burner Premium LTE Propane GrillYour new Blaze grill is the heartbeat of your BBQ Island. This is one of the best-selling grills in our history - a real workhorse that never disappoints. Crafted of 304 stainless steel, it also has stainless flame tamers and cast stainless steel cooking grates. It's built to last, and it's backed by the aforementioned lifetime warranty. It employs an ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, with a backup Flashtube and Crossover Channel system to ensure a good flame with every start. The flame tamers help keep flame-ups in check, and every inch of the grilling surface gets good and hot. Heat zone separators allow you to cook at different temperatures in each zone, so your asparagus doesn't have to fend for itself when you crank up the flame to sear your ribeyes.The grill includes a rear infrared burner to provide steady, reliable heat to rotisserie (kit sold separately), and an infrared main burner is available as an accessory if you want to establish a super-hot sear zone.The grill includes eye-catching red LED-illuminated grill knobs, plus internal halogen lights to illuminate the cooking surface. A 110-volt power source is required to run the lighting.Easier than Most Do-It-Yourself OptionsUnless you are pumped about surveying, pouring concrete, framing an island or cabinets, applying a stone or brick facing and installing a countertop, a BBQGuys Signature-Blaze Grill Island may be the perfect solution for your outdoor kitchen needs. All components ship together, usually on the same pallet. You're not adding a structure to your home, so you probably won't need a building permit or a contractor. Assembly is usually accomplished in an afternoon. You will need a helper to help you put the panels together and to lift the Blaze built-in gas grill into place, but there's nothing to cut or saw or weld. The kit comes with everything you need to put it together, and the only tool required is a Phillips head screwdriver.Additionally, the island has leveling feet, so the surface doesn't have to be perfectly flat and level. Because it's not permanently attached, you do have the option of setting it up on a deck.Much More Usable Than Just a GrillGive yourself a lot more storage! The center under-the-grill cabinet is set up to hold a 20-lb. liquid propane tank (and comes properly ventilated to allow propane to safely escape in the event of a leak), plus there's ample room for additional storage. To the left you get a drawer and a pull-out trash bin - which is something most people find indispensable once they have one! On the right are three drawers - with illuminated interiors (AAA batteries required)! The storage doors and drawers are soft close to absorb energy and allow the doors and drawers to close smoothly and silently. This also limits wear and tear on your cabinets. Plus...it's pretty cool.Blaze BBQ Islands are PortableMany people consider this to be a big advantage over a built-in BBQ island: you can move it around if needed. You can rearrange your deck or patio and move your island to accommodate layout changes. Try doing that with your brick island!Take It with You When You Go...or Don't!Because it's not permanently attached to your home, if you move you have the option of disassembling your Blaze BBQ Island and taking it with you to your new home. You also have the option of leaving it in place, and possibly including it in the home sale transaction (check with your real estate agent or attorney to find out how to work that out in your area). Fast, Easy OrderingWith the Blaze BBQ Island, you can order everything you need with a single Add to Cart click. All you do is select whether you want a grill that burns natural gas or propane. It really IS that simple!In most cases, everything will be shipped on a single pallet. You will want to have somebody help you take the boxes from the curb to your garage or backyard, because in total it weighs over 300 lbs. (the grill alone is over 100 lbs.).Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best-in-class Lifetime warranty12mm Hexagon-shaped stainless steel Searing Rods are extra thick for steakhouse-level searingHeat zone separators allow you to cook multiple types of food at the same time using different temperatures like an expert chefProfessional-quality, cast stainless steel H-burners deliver unbeatable cooking powerHeavy-duty, 12-gauge flame tamer grids cover the entire grill to minimize flare-ups for a luxury grilling experienceBlaze Professional LUX Delivers Commercial-Grade Power & Performance Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill \"professional\" if they did not mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner propane grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its 4 cast 304 stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-upsAbove the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this freestanding Blaze propane grill has all the makings of a luxury experience. Easy to Fire Up and AdjustStartup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time. Smart Engineering & Stylish EleganceEvery aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX freestanding 4-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.Sophisticated Design Meets PracticalityWhen it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered.

And speaking of storage, the freestanding Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner propane grill comes with 2 internally lit drawers and a large soft close door to stash your BBQ tools, propane tank, and anything else you need for an enjoyable afternoon of grilling.

Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill \"professional\" if they didn't mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 3-burner natural gas grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its three 304 cast stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-upsAbove the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this freestanding Blaze natural gas grill has all the makings of a luxury experience. Easy to Fire Up and AdjustStartup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time. Yes, Luxury Grilling is an Actual ThingEvery aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX freestanding 3-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.Sophisticated Design Meets PracticalityWhen it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Blaze LTE+ Collection adds industry-leading feature updates to the best-selling LTE lineNew design makes metal knobs shine red when on, indicating that gas is flowing. Knobs are also scored for added durability and grip.Updated internal lighting system makes for a more enjoyable grilling experienceSpring assisted hood makes opening and closing easier than everConvenient magnetic latch automatically turns on interior lights when hood is openThe Blaze Premium LTE+ natural gas grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.Eliminate Hot Spots for More Even Cooking with Ceramic Flame TamersThe Blaze Premium LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse.Beneath the grates rest Blaze's ceramic flame tamers, incorporating a 304 stainless steel tray with durable ceramic rods to create precision heat distribution throughout the cooking surface. The ceramic rods absorb drippings from your food and vaporizes them into a flavorful smoke that infuses the food. And as the name implies, your flames will be tamed with reduced flare ups, especially when cooking fatty meats. After each use, just burn off any food debris. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze Premium LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. Add it all up, and this marine grade Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze Premium LTE+ Marine Grade Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Pleasing to the eye and practical, it can handle a variety of cooking needs now and for years to come.  Vertical Rotisserie for Cooking Versatility   Deep-dish, flatbread, or any other style of pizza, this pizza oven is, of course, up to any pizza cooking challenge you throw at it, but with a built-in rotisserie rod and double cooking racks, you'll just as easily prepare a sumptuous rack of lamb as a delicious personal pie. After all the Blaze Pizza Oven is designed to be, well, an oven, which means you can cook just about anything on it \u2014 steaks, cookies, lasagna \u2014 you name it.   360-Degree Rotating Pizza Stone  Forget about having to stick your arm into a piping hot oven to twirl your pizza. The 17\" ceramic pizza stone rotates at the push of a button, so your family pizza night can truly incorporate the kids. Plus, by evenly distributing the heat from the oven (and eliminating any annoying cold spots), the stone will both ensure total pizza perfection and provide an excellent surface to cook so many other dishes.   From Low-and-Slow to Searing Heat  Tubular burners offer the capability to cook low and slow at 270 degrees or rip as high as 550 degrees while using the dual cooking racks. That's the kind of oven temperature range that allows for true cooking versatility.   Because the pizza stone is heated directly at the burners, its surface can reach 700 degrees, which means crispy, restaurant-quality pizza in mere minutes or any other foods that require serious heat.  Three Configuration Options to Suit Your Setup  In addition to the Countertop model, the Blaze Pizza Oven is also available in Built-in and Freestanding configurations. Compatible with Propane or Natural Gas  The Blaze pizza oven includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.

Made of 304-grade stainless steel with no vulnerable weld spots, this grill is built like a fortress to repel even the worst outdoor elements over years of use. The stainless steel grill hood, meanwhile, features a double lining that fittingly serves dual purposes: protecting the outer layer from heat discoloration, and trapping heat in the firebox for more intense searing temperatures. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area.  A grill this strong is good for years upon years of BBQs; are you up for the same challenge? High Performance: Fewer Hot/Cold Spots, Beautiful Sear Marks, & MoreSay goodbye to the days of grilling headaches - the Blaze Premium LTE makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, which is a breeze thanks to the Blaze Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for a grand total of 70,000 BTUs.In another huge win for performance, Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE built-in grill with patented triangular Searing Rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up massive amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots!Highly Convenient: Features to Fall ForThe most notable features on this Blaze gas grill are designed to be seen. Internal halogen lights give you a clear view of the grilling area when the BBQ lasts past sundown, while the red LED Illuminated Control System helps you monitor burner levels in the dark while adding a subdued hint of style. A removable warming rack sits inside the grill to keep cooked items hot, toast buns, or just provide a bit more grilling space when you are feeding a crowd. And cleanup? It does not get any easier than a removable, full-width drip tray on soft rollers. Now that is what we call premium!CSA Certified to the following Standard: CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesEasy-to-Assemble BBQ Island with a Blaze Premium LTE+ Marine Grade Propane GrillRust and corrosion resistant 316L stainless steel used for the grillAmple storage space for your grilling tools and more, plus a pull-out trash binBest-in-class Limited Lifetime Warranty on the grill and islandAssembly requires just two things: a Phillips head screwdriver, and a friendThe Blaze BBQ Island with the Blaze Premium LTE+ 32-inch Marine Grade propane grill  is a great way to add an outdoor kitchen to your home with a minimum of hassle, confusion, and hard work. You can literally have your new BBQ Island set up and cooking in a day.Everything Starts with the Blaze 4-Burner Premium LTE+ Propane GrillYour new Blaze grill is the heartbeat of your BBQ Island. This is one is an upgrade to one of the best-selling grills in our history \u2014 a real workhorse that never disappoints. Crafted of 316L stainless steel, it also has stainless flame tamers and cast stainless steel cooking grates. It's built to last, and it's backed by the aforementioned lifetime warranty. It employs an ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, with a backup Flashtube and Crossover Channel system to ensure a good flame with every start. The flame tamers help keep flame-ups in check, and every inch of the grilling surface gets good and hot. Heat zone separators allow you to cook at different temperatures in each zone, so your asparagus doesn't have to fend for itself when you crank up the flame to sear your ribeyes.The grill includes a rear infrared burner to provide steady, reliable heat to rotisserie (kit sold separately), and an infrared main burner is available as an accessory if you want to establish a super-hot sear zone.Upgrades include a lift-assist hood, updated LED-illuminated grill knobs that shine red when in position and blue when off, plus improved interior lights to illuminate the cooking surface. A 110-volt power source is required to run the lighting. The grill also includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Easier than Most Do-It-Yourself OptionsUnless you are pumped about surveying, pouring concrete, framing an island or cabinets, applying a stone or brick facing and installing a countertop, a Blaze Grill Island may be the perfect solution for your outdoor kitchen needs. All components ship together, usually on the same pallet. You're not adding a structure to your home, so you probably won't need a building permit or a contractor.Assembly is usually accomplished in an afternoon. You will need a helper to help you put the panels together and to lift the Blaze built-in gas grill into place, but there's nothing to cut or saw or weld. The kit comes with everything you need to put it together, and the only tool required is a Phillips head screwdriver.Additionally, the island has leveling feet, so the surface doesn't have to be perfectly flat and level. Because it's not permanently attached, you do have the option of setting it up on a deck.Much More Usable Than Just a GrillGive yourself a lot more storage! The center under-the-grill cabinet provides ample room for additional storage. To the left you get a drawer and a pull-out trash bin \u2014 which is something most people find indispensable once they have one! On the right are three drawers \u2014 with illuminated interiors (AAA batteries required)!The storage doors and drawers are soft close to absorb energy and allow the doors and drawers to close smoothly and silently. This also limits wear and tear on your cabinets. Plus\u2026it's pretty cool.Blaze BBQ Islands are PortableMany people consider this to be a big advantage over a built-in BBQ island: you can move it around if needed. You can rearrange your deck or patio and move your island to accommodate layout changes. Try doing that with your brick island!Take It with You When You Go\u2026or Don't!Because it's not permanently attached to your home, if you move you have the option of disassembling your Blaze BBQ Island and taking it with you to your new home. You also have the option of leaving it in place, and possibly including it in the home sale transaction (check with your real estate agent or attorney to find out how to work that out in your area).Fast, Easy OrderingWith the Blaze BBQ Island, you can order everything you need with a single Add to Cart click. All you do is select whether you want a grill that burns natural gas or propane. It really IS that simple!In most cases, everything will be shipped on a single pallet. You will want to have somebody help you take the boxes from the curb to your garage or backyard, because in total it weighs over 300 lbs. (the grill alone is over 100 lbs.).Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesEasy-to-Assemble BBQ Island with a Blaze Premium LTE+ Marine Grade Natural Gas GrillRust and corrosion resistant 316L stainless steel used for the grillAmple storage space for your grilling tools and more, plus a pull-out trash binBest-in-class Limited Lifetime Warranty on the grill and islandAssembly requires just two things: a Phillips head screwdriver, and a friendThe Blaze BBQ Island with the Blaze Premium LTE+ 32-inch Marine Grade natural gas grill  is a great way to add an outdoor kitchen to your home with a minimum of hassle, confusion, and hard work. You can literally have your new BBQ Island set up and cooking in a day.Everything Starts with the Blaze 4-Burner Premium LTE+ Natural Gas GrillYour new Blaze grill is the heartbeat of your BBQ Island. This is one is an upgrade to one of the best-selling grills in our history \u2014 a real workhorse that never disappoints. Crafted of 316L stainless steel, it also has stainless flame tamers and cast stainless steel cooking grates. It's built to last, and it's backed by the aforementioned lifetime warranty. It employs an ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, with a backup Flashtube and Crossover Channel system to ensure a good flame with every start. The flame tamers help keep flame-ups in check, and every inch of the grilling surface gets good and hot. Heat zone separators allow you to cook at different temperatures in each zone, so your asparagus doesn't have to fend for itself when you crank up the flame to sear your ribeyes.The grill includes a rear infrared burner to provide steady, reliable heat to rotisserie (kit sold separately), and an infrared main burner is available as an accessory if you want to establish a super-hot sear zone.Upgrades include a lift-assist hood, updated LED-illuminated grill knobs that shine red when in position and blue when off, plus improved interior lights to illuminate the cooking surface. A 110-volt power source is required to run the lighting. The grill also includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Easier than Most Do-It-Yourself OptionsUnless you are pumped about surveying, pouring concrete, framing an island or cabinets, applying a stone or brick facing and installing a countertop, a Blaze Grill Island may be the perfect solution for your outdoor kitchen needs. All components ship together, usually on the same pallet. You're not adding a structure to your home, so you probably won't need a building permit or a contractor.Assembly is usually accomplished in an afternoon. You will need a helper to help you put the panels together and to lift the Blaze built-in gas grill into place, but there's nothing to cut or saw or weld. The kit comes with everything you need to put it together, and the only tool required is a Phillips head screwdriver.Additionally, the island has leveling feet, so the surface doesn't have to be perfectly flat and level. Because it's not permanently attached, you do have the option of setting it up on a deck.Much More Usable Than Just a GrillGive yourself a lot more storage! The center under-the-grill cabinet provides ample room for additional storage. To the left you get a drawer and a pull-out trash bin \u2014 which is something most people find indispensable once they have one! On the right are three drawers \u2014 with illuminated interiors (AAA batteries required)!The storage doors and drawers are soft close to absorb energy and allow the doors and drawers to close smoothly and silently. This also limits wear and tear on your cabinets. Plus\u2026it's pretty cool.Blaze BBQ Islands are PortableMany people consider this to be a big advantage over a built-in BBQ island: you can move it around if needed. You can rearrange your deck or patio and move your island to accommodate layout changes. Try doing that with your brick island!Take It with You When You Go\u2026or Don't!Because it's not permanently attached to your home, if you move you have the option of disassembling your Blaze BBQ Island and taking it with you to your new home. You also have the option of leaving it in place, and possibly including it in the home sale transaction (check with your real estate agent or attorney to find out how to work that out in your area).Fast, Easy OrderingWith the Blaze BBQ Island, you can order everything you need with a single Add to Cart click. All you do is select whether you want a grill that burns natural gas or propane. It really IS that simple!In most cases, everything will be shipped on a single pallet. You will want to have somebody help you take the boxes from the curb to your garage or backyard, because in total it weighs over 300 lbs. (the grill alone is over 100 lbs.).Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBest-in-class lifetime residential warranty + 3 year multi-user commercial warrantyDurable 304 stainless steel construction to outlast the elementsHeavy duty 8mm stainless steel rod cooking grates allow for maximum searing capabilityCommercial-grade 16 gauge 304 stainless steel tube burners deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs eachPush & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures quick and reliable startup every timeCommercial-Style Grill for At-Home EntertainmentThe 25-inch Blaze Prelude LBM propane grill provides affordable commercial style grills designed with your outdoor BBQ challenges in mind. Grill with confidence behind the power of 3 commercial-grade, 16-gauge 304 stainless steel tube burners that deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs of cooking performance for a total of 42,000 BTUs. The 8mm stainless steel cooking rods enhance searing capability on a spacious 558 square inches of cooking area, more than enough to feed a crowd of hungry guests. Plus, Blazes Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures a reliable start every time; in the unlikely event it fails, the backup flash tube ignition and crossover channels step up to light the burners so you can grill on.Comes with 2 Tasty Sides: Cooking Versatility & Incredible WarrantiesOn other grills, cooking more than one item at a time can be a struggle. That's not the case for the Blaze Prelude LBM, which includes heat zone separators that help you create varying levels of heat with each burner. Sear on one side, slow roast on the other, and do everything in between to make sure your guests leave satisfied. Plus, the removable warming rack is an ideal place to keep bread and other food heated while you grill. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. As far as warranties go, it's hard to beat Blazes usual best-in-class, lifetime warranty but that didn't stop them from tacking on a 3-year, multi-user warranty that covers commercial settings like apartment complexes and condos.CSA Certified to the following Standard:CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Look no further than the ultra-reliable push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition, which features a backup flashtube and crossover channels system to ensure a steady flame with every start. Blaze's flame-tamer system is just as dependable: it keeps flare-ups in check, helps heat reach every corner of the grilling surface. The Blaze ceramic flame tamer incorporates a 304 stainless steel tray with durable ceramic rods to create precision heat distribution throughout the cooking surface. The ceramic rods absorb drippings from your food and vaporizes them into a flavorful smoke that infuses the food. And as the name implies, your flames will be tamed with reduced flare ups, especially when cooking fatty meats. After each use, just burn off any food debris.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Blaze LTE+ Collection adds industry-leading feature updates to the best-selling LTE lineNew design makes metal knobs shine red when on, indicating that gas is flowing. Knobs are also scored for added durability and grip.Updated internal lighting system makes for a more enjoyable grilling experienceSpring assisted hood makes opening and closing easier than everConvenient magnetic latch automatically turns on interior lights when hood is openThe Blaze Premium LTE+ propane grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.Effortless by DesignThe Blaze Premium LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for 70,000 BTUs.Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze Premium LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesEasy-to-Assemble BBQ Island paired with a Blaze Premium LTE+ Natural Gas GrillRust and corrosion resistant 304 stainless steel used for both the island and grillAmple storage space for your grilling tools and more, plus a pull-out trash binBest-in-class Limited Lifetime Warranty on the grill and islandAssembly requires just two things: a Phillips head screwdriver, and a friend!The Blaze BBQ Island with the Blaze Premium LTE+ natural gas grill is a great way to add an outdoor kitchen to your home with a minimum of hassle, confusion, and hard work. You can literally have your new BBQ Island set up and cooking in a day.Everything Starts with the Blaze 4-Burner Premium LTE+ Natural Gas GrillYour new Blaze grill is the heartbeat of your BBQ Island. This is one is an upgrade to one of the best-selling grills in our history \u2014 a real workhorse that never disappoints. Crafted of 304 stainless steel, it also has stainless flame tamers and cast stainless steel cooking grates. It's built to last, and it's backed by the aforementioned lifetime warranty. It employs an ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, with a backup Flashtube and Crossover Channel system to ensure a good flame with every start. The flame tamers help keep flame-ups in check, and every inch of the grilling surface gets good and hot. Heat zone separators allow you to cook at different temperatures in each zone, so your asparagus doesn't have to fend for itself when you crank up the flame to sear your ribeyes.The grill includes a rear infrared burner to provide steady, reliable heat to rotisserie (kit sold separately), and an infrared main burner is available as an accessory if you want to establish a super-hot sear zone.Upgrades include a lift-assist hood, updated LED-illuminated grill knobs that shine red when in position and blue when off, plus improved interior lights to illuminate the cooking surface. A 110-volt power source is required to run the lighting. The grill also includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Easier than Most Do-It-Yourself OptionsUnless you are pumped about surveying, pouring concrete, framing an island or cabinets, applying a stone or brick facing and installing a countertop, a Blaze Grill Island may be the perfect solution for your outdoor kitchen needs. All components ship together, usually on the same pallet. You're not adding a structure to your home, so you probably won't need a building permit or a contractor.Assembly is usually accomplished in an afternoon. You will need a helper to help you put the panels together and to lift the Blaze built-in gas grill into place, but there's nothing to cut or saw or weld. The kit comes with everything you need to put it together, and the only tool required is a Phillips head screwdriver.Additionally, the island has leveling feet, so the surface doesn't have to be perfectly flat and level. Because it's not permanently attached, you do have the option of setting it up on a deck.Much More Usable Than Just a GrillGive yourself a lot more storage! The center under-the-grill cabinet provides ample room for additional storage. To the left you get a drawer and a pull-out trash bin \u2014 which is something most people find indispensable once they have one! On the right are three drawers \u2014 with illuminated interiors (AAA batteries required)!The storage doors and drawers are soft close to absorb energy and allow the doors and drawers to close smoothly and silently. This also limits wear and tear on your cabinets. Plus\u2026it's pretty cool.Blaze BBQ Islands are PortableMany people consider this to be a big advantage over a built-in BBQ island: you can move it around if needed. You can rearrange your deck or patio and move your island to accommodate layout changes. Try doing that with your brick island!Take It with You When You Go\u2026or Don't!Because it's not permanently attached to your home, if you move you have the option of disassembling your Blaze BBQ Island and taking it with you to your new home. You also have the option of leaving it in place, and possibly including it in the home sale transaction (check with your real estate agent or attorney to find out how to work that out in your area).Fast, Easy OrderingWith the Blaze BBQ Island, you can order everything you need with a single Add to Cart click. All you do is select whether you want a grill that burns natural gas or propane. It really IS that simple!In most cases, everything will be shipped on a single pallet. You will want to have somebody help you take the boxes from the curb to your garage or backyard, because in total it weighs over 300 lbs. (the grill alone is over 100 lbs.).Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBest-in-class lifetime residential warranty + 3 year multi-user commercial warrantyDurable 304 stainless steel construction to outlast the elementsHeavy duty 8mm stainless steel rod cooking grates allow for maximum searing capabilityCommercial-grade 16 gauge 304 stainless steel tube burners deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs eachPush & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures quick and reliable startup every timeCommercial-Style Grill for At-Home EntertainmentThe 32-inch Blaze Prelude LBM natural gas grill provides affordable commercial style grills designed with your outdoor BBQ challenges in mind. Grill with confidence behind the power of 4 commercial-grade, 16-gauge stainless steel tube burners that deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs of cooking performance each (for a total of 56,000 BTUs). The 8mm stainless steel cooking rods enhance searing capability on a spacious 715 square inches of cooking area, more than enough to feed a crowd of hungry guests. Plus, Blazes Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures a reliable start every time; in the unlikely event it fails, the backup flash tube ignition and crossover channels step up to light the burners so you can grill on.Comes with 2 Tasty Sides: Cooking Versatility & Incredible WarrantiesOn other grills, cooking more than one item at a time can be a struggle. That's not the case for the Blaze Prelude LBM, which includes heat zone separators that help you create varying levels of heat with each burner. Sear on one side, slow roast on the other, and do everything in between to make sure your guests leave satisfied. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. As far as warranties go, it's hard to beat Blazes usual best-in-class, lifetime warranty but that didn't stop them from tacking on a 3-year, multi-user warranty that covers commercial settings like apartment complexes and condos.CSA Certified to the following Standard:CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best-in-class Lifetime warranty12mm Hexagon-shaped stainless steel Searing Rods are extra thick for steakhouse-level searingHeat zone separators allow you to cook multiple types of food at the same time using different temperatures like an expert chefProfessional-quality, cast stainless steel H-burners deliver unbeatable cooking powerHeavy-duty, 12-gauge flame tamers cover the entire grill to minimize flare-ups for a luxury grilling experienceBlaze Professional LUX Delivers Commercial-Grade Power & Performance Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill \"professional\" if they did not mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner natural gas grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its 4 cast 304 stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-upsAbove the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this freestanding Blaze natural gas grill has all the makings of a luxury experience. Easy to Fire Up and AdjustStartup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time. Smart Engineering & Stylish EleganceEvery aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX freestanding 4-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.Sophisticated Design Meets PracticalityWhen it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 1,050 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry. Professional, indeed!Fully-Loaded Grill CartA grill this awesome simply cannot be contained... sometimes literally. To help you spread your wings as a grill master, Blaze designed a decked-out grill cart on 4 heavy-duty, locking wheels that make relocating the grill as easy as searing on the extra-thick cooking grates. The cart is built from high-quality stainless steel for years of outdoor use and features 2 side shelves that allow you to prep everything without leaving the backyard, then fold down when not in use to save valuable storage space. And speaking of storage, the freestanding Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner natural gas grill comes with 2 internally lit drawers and a large soft close door to stash your BBQ tools, natural gas tank, and anything else you need for an enjoyable afternoon of grilling. The drawer LEDs require 4 AAA batteries to operate, so no transformer is needed.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze Grills offers a best-in-class Lifetime warranty12mm Hexagon-shaped stainless steel Searing Rods are extra thick for steakhouse-level searingHeat zone separators allow you to cook multiple types of food at the same time using different temperatures like an expert chefProfessional-quality, cast stainless steel H-burners deliver unbeatable cooking powerHeavy-duty, 12-gauge flame tamer grids cover the entire grill to minimize flare-ups for a luxury grilling experienceBlaze Professional LUX Delivers Commercial-Grade Power & Performance Get superior performance from Start to Come-and-Get-It! Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill \"professional\" if they didn't mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 3-burner propane grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its three 304 cast stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-upsAbove the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this freestanding Blaze propane grill has all the makings of a luxury experience. Easy to Fire Up and AdjustStartup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time. Yes, Luxury Grilling is an Actual ThingEvery aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX freestanding 3-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.Sophisticated Design Meets PracticalityWhen it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 615 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry. Professional, indeed!Fully-Loaded Grill CartA grill this awesome simply can't be contained... sometimes literally. To help you spread your wings as a grill master, Blaze designed a decked-out grill cart on 4 heavy-duty, locking wheels that make relocating the grill as easy as searing on the extra-thick cooking grates. The cart is built from high-quality stainless steel for years of outdoor use and features 2 side shelves that allow you to prep everything without leaving the backyard, then fold down when not in use to save valuable storage space. And speaking of storage, the freestanding Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner propane grill comes with 2 internally lit drawers and a large soft close door to stash your BBQ tools, propane tank, and anything else you need for an enjoyable afternoon of grilling. The drawer LEDs require 4 AAA batteries to operate, so no transformer is needed.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Blaze LTE+ Collection adds industry-leading feature updates to the best-selling LTE lineNew design makes metal knobs shine red when on, indicating that gas is flowing. Knobs are also scored for added durability and grip.Updated internal lighting system makes for a more enjoyable grilling experienceSpring assisted hood makes opening and closing easier than everConvenient magnetic latch automatically turns on interior lights when hood is openThe Blaze Premium LTE+ natural gas grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.Effortless by DesignThe Blaze Premium LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for 70,000 BTUs.Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse.

Grill with confidence behind the power of 3 commercial-grade, 16-gauge 304 stainless steel tube burners that deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs of cooking performance for a total of 42,000 BTUs. The 8mm stainless steel cooking rods enhance searing capability on a spacious 558 square inches of cooking area, more than enough to feed a crowd of hungry guests. Plus, Blazes Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures a reliable start every time; in the unlikely event it fails, the backup flash tube ignition and crossover channels step up to light the burners so you can grill on.Comes with 2 Tasty Sides: Cooking Versatility & Incredible WarrantiesOn other grills, cooking more than one item at a time can be a struggle. That's not the case for the Blaze Prelude LBM, which includes heat zone separators that help you create varying levels of heat with each burner. Sear on one side, slow roast on the other, and do everything in between to make sure your guests leave satisfied. Plus, the removable warming rack is an ideal place to keep bread and other food heated while you grill. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. As far as warranties go, it's hard to beat Blazes usual best-in-class, lifetime warranty but that didn't stop them from tacking on a 3-year, multi-user warranty that covers commercial settings like apartment complexes and condos.CSA Certified to the following Standard:CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Blaze Premium LTE natural gas grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double-lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. Lasting looks and expert engineering? Sounds like a Blaze grill to us!Easy Lighting & Trusty Flame TamersNo need to delay the best part of your BBQ: the grilling! The Blaze Push & Turn Flame-Thrower with Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels ignition system provides a steady and reliable flame with every start, no waiting required. The heat of those flames is evenly dispersed across the grilling area thanks to the full-width flame tamers, a 14-gauge stainless steel system that makes you forget hot and cold spots ever existed. As a bonus, they turn what would be flare-ups into flavorful wisps of smoke - that is what we call a win-win!Now for some numbers: 70,000 combined BTUs from 5 cast stainless steel burners, each of which stands up to the demands of outdoor cooking. OK, that is enough numbers; what you really care about is how your food tastes and looks, so Blaze developed a patented triangle shape for its Searing Rods. With a flat bottom to soak up heat and a single point to direct it all to the food, you will walk away with stunning sear marks every time.Light Up Your Grill - and Faces Around the TableGrill at any time with an LED Illuminated Control System, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red in the evening. Sophisticated looks are one thing, but the pair of internal halogen lights are all about function, giving you a clear view of the grilling surface for those cookouts that last a little longer than anticipated. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to even begin to worry about cleanup - it is as simple as can be thanks to a removable, full-width drip tray! Add it all up, and this Blaze brings a premium experience in every way.CSA Certified to the following Standard: CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Look no further than the ultra-reliable push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition, which features a backup flashtube and crossover channels system to ensure a steady flame with every start.

The Blaze ceramic flame tamer incorporates a 304 stainless steel tray with durable ceramic rods to create precision heat distribution throughout the cooking surface. The ceramic rods absorb drippings from your food and vaporizes them into a flavorful smoke that infuses the food. And as the name implies, your flames will be tamed with reduced flare ups, especially when cooking fatty meats. After each use, just burn off any food debris.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Blaze LTE+ Collection adds industry-leading feature updates to the best-selling LTE lineNew design makes metal knobs shine red when on, indicating that gas is flowing. Knobs are also scored for added durability and grip.Updated internal lighting system makes for a more enjoyable grilling experienceSpring assisted hood makes opening and closing easier than everConvenient magnetic latch automatically turns on interior lights when hood is openThe Blaze Premium LTE+ propane grill is made from commercial-grade stainless steel, making it extra tough in outdoor environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.Eliminate Hot Spots for More Even Cooking with Ceramic Flame TamersThe Blaze Premium LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Blaze outfitted the Premium LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse.Beneath the grates rest Blaze's ceramic flame tamers, incorporating a 304 stainless steel tray with durable ceramic rods to create precision heat distribution throughout the cooking surface. The ceramic rods absorb drippings from your food and vaporizes them into a flavorful smoke that infuses the food. And as the name implies, your flames will be tamed with reduced flare ups, especially when cooking fatty meats. After each use, just burn off any food debris. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze Premium LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze Premium LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse.Beneath the grates rest Blaze's ceramic flame tamers, incorporating a 304 stainless steel tray with durable ceramic rods to create precision heat distribution throughout the cooking surface. The ceramic rods absorb drippings from your food and vaporizes them into a flavorful smoke that infuses the food. And as the name implies, your flames will be tamed with reduced flare ups, especially when cooking fatty meats. After each use, just burn off any food debris. No more dreaded hot or cold spots\u2014just consistent temperatures.New, Innovative FeaturesGrill at any time with the Premium LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience.

And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze Premium LTE+ is their best grill yet.Please note that a 110V power source is required.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesEasy-to-Assemble BBQ Island paired with a Blaze Premium LTE+ Propane GrillRust and corrosion resistant 304 stainless steel used for both the island and grillAmple storage space for your grilling tools and more, plus a pull-out trash binBest-in-class Limited Lifetime Warranty on the grill and islandAssembly requires just two things: a Phillips head screwdriver, and a friend!The Blaze BBQ Island with the Blaze Premium LTE+ propane grill is a great way to add an outdoor kitchen to your home with a minimum of hassle, confusion, and hard work. You can literally have your new BBQ Island set up and cooking in a day.Everything Starts with the Blaze 4-Burner Premium LTE+ Propane GrillYour new Blaze grill is the heartbeat of your BBQ Island. This is one is an upgrade to one of the best-selling grills in our history \u2014 a real workhorse that never disappoints. Crafted of 304 stainless steel, it also has stainless flame tamers and cast stainless steel cooking grates. It's built to last, and it's backed by the aforementioned lifetime warranty. It employs an ultra-reliable Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition, with a backup Flashtube and Crossover Channel system to ensure a good flame with every start. The flame tamers help keep flame-ups in check, and every inch of the grilling surface gets good and hot. Heat zone separators allow you to cook at different temperatures in each zone, so your asparagus doesn't have to fend for itself when you crank up the flame to sear your ribeyes.The grill includes a rear infrared burner to provide steady, reliable heat to rotisserie (kit sold separately), and an infrared main burner is available as an accessory if you want to establish a super-hot sear zone.Upgrades include a lift-assist hood, updated LED-illuminated grill knobs that shine red when in position and blue when off, plus improved interior lights to illuminate the cooking surface. A 110-volt power source is required to run the lighting. The grill also includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.Easier than Most Do-It-Yourself OptionsUnless you are pumped about surveying, pouring concrete, framing an island or cabinets, applying a stone or brick facing and installing a countertop, a Blaze Grill Island may be the perfect solution for your outdoor kitchen needs. All components ship together, usually on the same pallet. You're not adding a structure to your home, so you probably won't need a building permit or a contractor.Assembly is usually accomplished in an afternoon. You will need a helper to help you put the panels together and to lift the Blaze built-in gas grill into place, but there's nothing to cut or saw or weld. The kit comes with everything you need to put it together, and the only tool required is a Phillips head screwdriver.Additionally, the island has leveling feet, so the surface doesn't have to be perfectly flat and level. Because it's not permanently attached, you do have the option of setting it up on a deck.Much More Usable Than Just a GrillGive yourself a lot more storage! The center under-the-grill cabinet is set up to hold a 20-lb. liquid propane tank (and comes properly ventilated to allow propane to safely escape in the event of a leak), plus there's ample room for additional storage. To the left you get a drawer and a pull-out trash bin \u2014 which is something most people find indispensable once they have one! On the right are three drawers \u2014 with illuminated interiors (AAA batteries required)!The storage doors and drawers are soft close to absorb energy and allow the doors and drawers to close smoothly and silently. This also limits wear and tear on your cabinets. Plus\u2026it's pretty cool.Blaze BBQ Islands are PortableMany people consider this to be a big advantage over a built-in BBQ island: you can move it around if needed. You can rearrange your deck or patio and move your island to accommodate layout changes. Try doing that with your brick island!Take It with You When You Go\u2026or Don't!Because it's not permanently attached to your home, if you move you have the option of disassembling your Blaze BBQ Island and taking it with you to your new home. You also have the option of leaving it in place, and possibly including it in the home sale transaction (check with your real estate agent or attorney to find out how to work that out in your area).Fast, Easy OrderingWith the Blaze BBQ Island, you can order everything you need with a single Add to Cart click. All you do is select whether you want a grill that burns natural gas or propane. It really IS that simple!In most cases, everything will be shipped on a single pallet. You will want to have somebody help you take the boxes from the curb to your garage or backyard, because in total it weighs over 300 lbs. (the grill alone is over 100 lbs.).Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBest-in-class lifetime residential warranty + 3 year multi-user commercial warrantyDurable 304 stainless steel construction to outlast the elementsHeavy duty 8mm stainless steel rod cooking grates allow for maximum searing capabilityCommercial-grade 16 gauge 304 stainless steel tube burners deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs eachPush & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures quick and reliable startup every timeCommercial-Style Grill for At-Home EntertainmentThe 32-inch Blaze Prelude LBM propane grill provides affordable commercial style grills designed with your outdoor BBQ challenges in mind. Grill with confidence behind the power of 4 commercial-grade, 16-gauge stainless steel tube burners that deliver an impressive 14,000 BTUs of cooking performance each (for a total of 56,000 BTUs). The 8mm stainless steel cooking rods enhance searing capability on a spacious 715 square inches of cooking area, more than enough to feed a crowd of hungry guests. Plus, Blazes Push & Turn flame-thrower ignition ensures a reliable start every time; in the unlikely event it fails, the backup flash tube ignition and crossover channels step up to light the burners so you can grill on.Comes with 2 Tasty Sides: Cooking Versatility & Incredible WarrantiesOn other grills, cooking more than one item at a time can be a struggle. That's not the case for the Blaze Prelude LBM, which includes heat zone separators that help you create varying levels of heat with each burner. Sear on one side, slow roast on the other, and do everything in between to make sure your guests leave satisfied. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. As far as warranties go, it's hard to beat Blazes usual best-in-class, lifetime warranty but that didn't stop them from tacking on a 3-year, multi-user warranty that covers commercial settings like apartment complexes and condos.CSA Certified to the following Standard:CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliancesLegal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesBlaze offers a best in class Lifetime warrantySolid cast aluminum construction offers superior durability and outstanding temperature controlUnique tongue and groove design provides an exceptional seal with no heat loss12mm thick stainless steel cooking grate retains heat and helps you achieve an excellent searEnclosed cabinet, shelves and hooks keep supplies conveniently locatedReintroducing a tough kamado grill designed to provide a lifetime of performance and memories.  Made from one inch thick solid cast aluminum, the Blaze Kamado offers superior durability and outstanding temperature control.  The non-porous grill body allows you to use any type of charcoal or wood, as well as any material for lighting the charcoal without worry of it damaging or being absorbed into the grill body.  The heavy-duty, 12mm thick 304 stainless steel cooking grate retains heat and helps you achieve an excellent sear.  The 20-inch diameter cooking grate is hinged on both sides so you can easily add wood or charcoal without needing to remove it.  A mid-level 18-inch cooking grate is also included which allows you to cook closer to the fire.  Add a drip pan or a heat deflector for indirect cooking.  The lid hinge is made from 304 stainless steel and features a convenient lift assist for easy opening and closing.  The Blaze Kamado grill also boasts an innovative lid seal that is superior to ceramic kamado-style grills.  Instead of using a felt gasket, the cast aluminum Blaze Kamado utilizes a tongue and groove seal.  This design eliminates the need to replace a damaged gasket and also provides an exceptional seal that prevents heat from escaping.  The top exhaust vent is made from molded cast aluminum for precise heat control and will not slip out of position.  The bottom of the firebox holds a removable stainless steel ash pan with handles for easy cleanup.  A large temperature gauge with markings for smoking, roasting and searing temperatures is mounted in the lid, allowing you to easily monitor cooking temperatures.  The cart features two soft close front doors for storing your charcoal, grill cover and BBQ accessories.  It also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Let's start with the storage: mounted inside the left-hand door is a paper towel holder that allows you to keep cleanup supplies close, and the unit itself contains valuable space to hold grilling equipment. Its main focus, though, is to provide access to gas lines for safety and maintenance. Then there's the style, with sleek-yet-sturdy 304-grade stainless steel construction and a beveled design for heightened aesthetics and structural integrity. The soft close hinges prevent the doors from slamming shut. Throw in a pair of straight handles to accentuate those carefully crafted looks, and you've got access doors that pull double duty.

By offering precision heat distribution, you can ensure a thoroughly cooked every time you host an outdoor event. Intended to replace your standard flame tamer set, this is the perfect upgrade for those seeking to enhance their grilling capabilities. Even more than that, the food will taste better as Blaze's ceramic flame tamer rods absorb drippings from your cook and vaporizes them, creating a flavorful smoke that infuses into the food. But vaporization doesn't mean flare-ups because the round design of these ceramic rods allow grease to easily roll off, making grilling safe and more convenient, especially when cooking fatty meats. The Blaze Ceramic Flame Tamer's tray is constructed from the highest quality 304 stainless steel and paired with the most durable ceramic rods, which can withstand high temperatures without deteriorating and, unlike metal shields, are less likely to rust or degrade over time. Plus, after each use you'll simply need to burn off any food debris to clean. The Ceramic Flame Tamer is the perfect addition to your Blaze Premium LTE grill, providing even heat and maximum flavor with minimum maintenance. Designed for use with all sizes of Blaze Prelude LBM, Premium LTE, & Premium LTE+ gas grills only.

By offering precision heat distribution, you can ensure a thoroughly cooked every time you host an outdoor event. Intended to replace your standard flame tamer set, this is the perfect upgrade for those seeking to enhance their grilling capabilities. Even more than that, the food will taste better as Blaze's ceramic flame tamer rods absorb drippings from your cook and vaporizes them, creating a flavorful smoke that infuses into the food. But vaporization doesn't mean flare-ups because the round design of these ceramic rods allow grease to easily roll off, making grilling safe and more convenient, especially when cooking fatty meats. The Blaze Ceramic Flame Tamer's tray is constructed from the highest quality 304 stainless steel and paired with the most durable ceramic rods, which can withstand high temperatures without deteriorating and, unlike metal shields, are less likely to rust or degrade over time. Plus, after each use you'll simply need to burn off any food debris to clean.

By offering precision heat distribution, you can ensure a thoroughly cooked every time you host an outdoor event. Intended to replace your standard flame tamer set, this is the perfect upgrade for those seeking to enhance their grilling capabilities. Even more than that, the food will taste better as Blaze's ceramic flame tamer rods absorb drippings from your cook and vaporizes them, creating a flavorful smoke that infuses into the food. But vaporization doesn't mean flare-ups because the round design of these ceramic rods allow grease to easily roll off, making grilling safe and more convenient, especially when cooking fatty meats. The Blaze Ceramic Flame Tamer's tray is constructed from the highest quality 304 stainless steel and paired with the most durable ceramic rods, which can withstand high temperatures without deteriorating and, unlike metal shields, are less likely to rust or degrade over time. Plus, after each use you'll simply need to burn off any food debris to clean.
