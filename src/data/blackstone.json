This one-of-a-kind pizza oven can reach temps of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit and can cook pizzas in as little as 90 seconds. With Patented 2Stone Tech that features both a fixed upper cordierite stone and rotating lower cordierite stone for an even and consistent heating, you'll never have to turn your pizza oven mid-cook like you have to with other ovens on the market. Simply put the pizza in, let it cook, and take it back out, with no need to turn it while it's cooking. This outdoor pizza oven comes with handles on each side and a detachable base, so you can use it as a standalone unit on your patio, or place it on your countertop for another pizza cooking experience. The base features four swivel wheels, so you can easily move it around the back patio until it's exactly where you want it to be. And no need to have your propane tank out in the open; you can store your tank right inside the pizza oven stand. Last but not least, the Blackstone Pizza Oven with Stand includes an aluminum pizza peel that fits neatly into a designated spot on the pizza oven base, so you've got the basics to get started on your backyard pizza pie journey.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

With 55,000 BTUs of cooking power, you can cook pizzas in as little as 90 seconds. The second burner specifically controls the cook of the crust so your pizzas will be perfect every time.  Rotating stone technology ensures an even cook. The top stone radiates even heat to the top of the pizza. This pizza oven cooks all types of pizzas from thick crust pizzas to Neapolitan. Cook steaks, chicken wings, and anything you can imagine. The caster wheels lock in place and have a treaded tire for smooth and easy rolling. The included pizza peel sits in a holster that mounts to either side of the cart. Soft close hinges keep the door closed in windy conditions and the 304 stainless steel looks great in any environment.  Also, the cooking body can be removed from the cart for a table top configuration.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
