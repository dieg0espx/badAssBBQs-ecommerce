This 36-inch, built-in pellet grill features intuitive digital touch screen controls and features that help take the guesswork out of grilling. Heavy-duty 304 stainless steel construction ensures years of outdoor use. The double-walled hood with a gasket keeps heat contained for added efficiency and more consistent grilling temperatures, it also has a built in spring mechanism for easy opening, and a wind-guard to protect against drafts. The front-loading hopper provides an easier way to add fuel and holds up to 15 lbs of pellets at a time. The Coyote Smart Drop pellet feed system features dual augers and is compatible with any flavored wood pellets. Heavy duty, laser-cut 304 stainless steel cooking grates provide extra surface contact for great sear marks. The Coyote Versa-Rack system allows you to expand the warming rack for additional cooking surface area. This pellet grill easily converts from smoking to searing mode with the included interchangeable burn pot grates and removal tool. A dual fan convection system allows precise temperature control ranging from 175 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on which burn pot grate is in use. Three temperature probes are included for easy monitoring of internal food temperatures using the digital control panel. Interior grill lighting and an LED temperature probe port light allow you to grill in any lighting.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
