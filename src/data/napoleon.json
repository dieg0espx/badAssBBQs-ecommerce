        "Description": "Key FeaturesBuilt-in trim for a truly seamless installationConstructed from 304 grade stainless steel for durability and longevityQuick and reliable ignition system every time you fire up the grillVirtually maintenance-free cooking grids that give food the iconic Napoleon Wave sear marksMultilevel grilling with the two position warming rack for perfect cooking or keeping food warmNapoleon Reliability in a Built-in Grill Napoleon's Built-in 500 Series Propane Grill is designed to install seamlessly into your BBQ island. Made with 304 Stainless Steel, the Built-in 500 grill is durable and stylish, laser-focused on performance. 4 Stainless Steel Burners Burners are the heart of any gas grill. Napoleon's 16-gauge premium 304 stainless steel burner tubes are reinforced and feature an industry-leading design that provides proven longevity, performance, and efficiency. Complete combustion is the key, and these burners balance fuel and oxygen to generate a clean burn. Dual gas ports on the top and sides of each burner ensure even heating along the burner and produced fewer flare-ups. Instant JETFIRE Ignition If a grill doesn't reliably light, it's not a reliable grill. Napoleon's Instant JETFIRE ignition lights the first time, every time. The design sends a jet of flame to light each burner individually. You can light your grill with the twist of your writs. Batteries not required! With cross-lighting burners, in the unlikely event that a burner goes out or fails to light, it automatically relights. There's a cross-light bracket between burners that passes the flame to the unlit burner, assuring safe and reliable grilling. Dual-Level Stainless Steel Sear PlatesNapoleon's sear plates help create the kind of BBQ flavor you love. When you grill, the plates are heated. As juices and sauces drip onto the plates, the drippings are vaporized to create smoke and steam that bathes the food in flavor. Additionally, the sear plates are staggered on multi-levels, creating even coverage across the grilling surface. This helps ensure even heating throughout your grill.7.5mm Stainless Steel Iconic Wave Cooking Grids Never underestimate the power of heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grids! As you can see, the Wave design is like no other, but it's not just because they look cool. The wave encourages even heating and provides more surface area, prevents food from falling through, and keeps the grill cleaner. The shape increases the grates' longevity by allowing for even expansion and contraction, reducing heat and cold's effect on the metal.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesBuilt-in trim for a truly seamless installationConstructed from 304 grade stainless steel for durability and longevityQuick and reliable ignition system every time you fire up the grillVirtually maintenance-free cooking grids that give food the iconic Napoleon Wave sear marksMultilevel grilling with the two position warming rack for perfect cooking or keeping food warmNapoleon Reliability in a Built-in Grill Napoleon Built-in 500 Series Natural Gas Grill is designed to install seamlessly into your BBQ island. Made with 304 Stainless Steel, the Built-in 500 grill is durable and stylish, laser-focused on performance. 4 Stainless Steel Burners Burners are the heart of any gas grill. Napoleon 16-gauge premium 304 stainless steel burner tubes are reinforced and feature an industry-leading design that provides proven longevity, performance, and efficiency. Complete combustion is the key, and these burners balance fuel and oxygen to generate a clean burn. Dual gas ports on the top and sides of each burner ensure even heating along the burner and produced fewer flare-ups. Instant JETFIRE Ignition If a grill does not reliably light, it is not a reliable grill. Napoleon Instant JETFIRE ignition lights the first time, every time. The design sends a jet of flame to light each burner individually. You can light your grill with the twist of your writs. Batteries not required! With cross-lighting burners, in the unlikely event that a burner goes out or fails to light, it automatically relights. There is a cross-light bracket between burners that passes flame to the unlit burner, assuring safe and reliable grilling. Dual-Level Stainless Steel Sear PlatesNapoleon sear plates help create the kind of BBQ flavor you love. When you grill, the plates are heated. As juices and sauces drip onto the, the drippings are vaporized to create smoke and steam that bathes the food in flavor. Additionally, the sear plates are staggered on multi levels, creating even coverage across the grilling surface. This helps ensure even heating throughout your grill.7.5mm Stainless Steel Iconic Wave Cooking Grids Never underestimate the power of heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grids! As you can see, the Wave design is like no other, but it is not just because they look cool. The wave encourages even heating and provides more surface area, prevents food from falling through, and keeps the grill cleaner. The shape increases the grates longevity by allowing for even expansion and contraction, reducing the effect that heat and cold have on the metal.

This built-in natural gas grill has a twin head cooking system for more grilling versatility. Sear the perfect steak using the infrared burner while you bake a cake on the conventional side. One side has four stainless steel tube burners that provide up to 48,000 BTUs of cooking power while the other side has two ceramic infrared burners that produce 24,000 BTUs, reaching high heat in seconds, and ideal for searing restaurant quality steaks. The two infrared burners have an 8,000 BTU stainless steel tube warming burner between them. The grill has stainless steel cooking grates with 825 square inches of main cooking area and 420 square inches across the stainless steel warming area for a total of 1245 square inches of cooking area. Easily turn the burners on with a flame thrower ignition for a reliable start up. The stainless steel wave cooking grids create the trademark Napoleon sear lines. The stainless steel, self-cleaning sear plates vaporize drippings, control flare ups and keep your food moist. The Prestige PRO 825 also has a 18,000 BTU stainless steel rear infrared burner for slow cooking with the rotisserie kit. An integrated wood chip smoker tray pulls out for easy filling and has a dedicated 8,000 BTU burner that creates delicious smoke flavor. The hood features an Accu-Probe temperature gauge, stainless steel end caps and retains heat for oven-like performance. The LED Spectrum Night Light control knobs have near limitless color options making your night time entertaining a breeze, and they glow red when a burner is in use while two interior lights illuminate the grilling surface. Clean up is a cinch with the full width removable drip pan. This Napoleon grill is manufactured in Canada.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin head cooking system features a separate searing section instead of taking up space on the main grilling areaLED Spectrum Night Light control knobs with SafetyGlowFour stainless steel burners deliver impressive heat and longevityRear infrared rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit allows you to slow roast food with restaurant quality resultsWood chip tray with dedicated burner infuses your food with smokey aromaticsThe Napoleon Prestige PRO 825 combines the power of infrared grilling and the Napoleon stainless steel cooking system in one grill. This freestanding natural gas grill has a twin head cooking system for more grilling versatility. Sear the perfect steak using the infrared burner while you bake a cake on the conventional side. One side has four stainless steel tube burners that provide up to 48,000 BTUs of cooking power while the other side has two ceramic infrared burners that produce 24,000 BTUs, reaching high heat in seconds, and ideal for searing restaurant quality steaks. The two infrared burners have an 8,000 BTU stainless steel tube warming burner between them. The grill has stainless steel cooking grates with 825 square inches of main cooking area and 420 square inches across the stainless steel warming area for a total of 1245 square inches of cooking area. Easily turn the burners on with a flame thrower ignition for a reliable start up. The stainless steel wave cooking grids create the trademark Napoleon sear lines. The stainless steel, self-cleaning sear plates vaporize drippings, control flare ups and keep your food moist. The Prestige PRO 825 also has an 18,000 BTU stainless steel rear infrared burner for slow cooking with the rotisserie kit and a 17,000 BTU power side burner. An integrated wood chip smoker tray pulls out for easy filling and has a dedicated 8,000 BTU burner that creates delicious smoke flavor. The hood features an Accu-Probe temperature gauge, stainless steel end caps and retains heat for oven-like performance. The LED Spectrum Night Light control knobs have near limitless color options making your nighttime entertaining a breeze, and they glow red when a burner is in use while two interior lights illuminate the grilling surface. Clean up is a cinch with the full width removable drip pan. The stainless steel grill cart also features two pull-out drawers and double doors for storage and easy roll locking casters for moving the grill around. Minimal assembly is required because the grill cart comes fully assembled with the exception of the cart side shelves and the grill head. Please note, due to the weight of this item white glove delivery service is not available. This Napoleon grill is manufactured in Canada.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

This freestanding propane gas grill has a twin head cooking system for more grilling versatility. Sear the perfect steak using the infrared burner while you bake a cake on the conventional side. One side has four stainless steel tube burners that provide up to 48,000 BTUs of cooking power while the other side has two ceramic infrared burners that produce 24,000 BTUs, reaching high heat in seconds, and ideal for searing restaurant quality steaks. The two infrared burners have an 8,000 BTU stainless steel tube warming burner between them. The grill has stainless steel cooking grates with 825 square inches of main cooking area and 420 square inches across the stainless steel warming area for a total of 1245 square inches of cooking area. Easily turn the burners on with a flame thrower ignition for a reliable start up. The stainless steel wave cooking grids create the trademark Napoleon sear lines. The stainless steel, self-cleaning sear plates vaporize drippings, control flare ups and keep your food moist. The Prestige PRO 825 also has an 18,000 BTU stainless steel rear infrared burner for slow cooking with the rotisserie kit and a 17,000 BTU power side burner. An integrated wood chip smoker tray pulls out for easy filling and has a dedicated 8,000 BTU burner that creates delicious smoke flavor. The hood features an Accu-Probe temperature gauge, stainless steel end caps and retains heat for oven-like performance. The LED Spectrum Night Light control knobs have near limitless color options making your night time entertaining a breeze, and they glow red when a burner is in use while two interior lights illuminate the grilling surface. Clean up is a cinch with the full width removable drip pan. The stainless steel grill cart also features two pull-out drawers and double doors for storage and easy roll locking casters for moving the grill around. Minimal assembly is required because the grill cart comes fully assembled with the exception of the cart side shelves and the grill head. Please note, due to the weight of this item white glove delivery service is not available.

They packed performance into an eye-catching form and created freestanding grills with carts that are more than just a stand for a grill.  Phantom Matte Black Finished Surfaces If you dont want to be like everybody else on the block with a shiny silver-ish grill, Napoleons Phantom Rogue SE 425 RSIB Natural Gas Grill offers edgy styling with luxurious, silky black matte finishes. Napoleon refers to it as low-key luxury, but it's more than just a look  these grills offer high performance AND high styling! Infrared Rear Rotisserie Burner Perfect for high heat searing and slow spit roasting for succulent roasted meals. (Rotisserie kit sold separately) Large Infrared Sizzle Zone™ Side BurnerGet the perfect steakhouse-quality sear! The Phantom Rogue SE 425 RSIB's IR side burner is more efficient and gets much hotter (up to 1,800 degrees F!) than a conventional burner, giving it the power to quickly sear meat and deliver the much-desired caramelized crust, sealing in flavor and juices. With an infrared burner, you're actually cooking with the power of light energy. 3 Stainless Steel Burners Burners are the heart of any gas grill. Napoleon's 16-gauge premium 304 stainless steel burner tubes are reinforced and feature an industry-leading design that provides proven longevity, performance, and efficiency. Complete combustion is the key, and these burners balance fuel and oxygen to generate a clean burn. Dual gas ports on the top and sides of each burner ensure even heating along the burner and produced fewer flare-ups. Instant JETFIRE™ Ignition  If a grill doesn't reliably light, it's not a reliable grill. Napoleon's Instant JETFIRE ignition lights the first time, every time. The design sends a jet of flame to light each burner individually. You can light your grill with the twist of your writs. Batteries not required! With cross-lighting burners, in the unlikely event that a burner goes out or fails to light, it automatically relights. There's a cross-light bracket between burners that passes flame to the unlit burner, assuring safe and reliable grilling. High Top Lid Napoleon Rogue heavy-duty high top lids pivot on a central point to keep the opening within the same space as the body of the grill. In addition, though the lids are heavy, the design provides leverage to easily lift the grill's lid. The higher height gives you space to grill larger meats, and the double layer of insulation works to keep the heat in and helps it circulate for greater heat control. Stainless Steel Iconic Wave Cooking Grids Never underestimate the power of heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grids! As you can see, the Wave design is like no other and it's not just because they look cool. The wave encourages even heating and provides more surface area, prevents food from falling through, and keeps the grill cleaner. The shape increases the grates' longevity by allowing for even expansion and contraction, reducing the effect that heat and cold have on the metal. Backlit Ergonomic Control Knobs Like the feel of a steering wheel, or the knobs of a high-end stereo, the smooth grip and robust shape of the Rogue knobs give you excellent control. Illuminated to prevent the where do I have everything set? guessing game after the sun goes down. A Grill Cart that is Much More than Just a Cart The Phantom Rogue SE 425 RSIB's cart is functional and offers features not generally found at this price point. The enclosed design protects the contents from the elements and provides long-lasting durability. There are tool hooks on each side shelf to help you keep your grilling tools within reach without cluttering up the stainless steel folding shelf, and a condiment basket to store your favorite spices and sauces. The cart rests on locking casters for extra stability.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesGrill in style with premium Phantom matte black finished surfacesMultifunctional warming rack designed with cutouts for grilling wings and appetizersHigh heat infrared side burner allows you to sear just like a steakhouseRear infrared rotisserie burner allows you to slow roast food with restaurant quality resultsGrill cart features, tool hooks, folding side shelves, propane tank stability ring, and easy locking caster wheelsGoing Rogue has Never Tasted So Good Napoleon put a great deal of thought into designing their Rogue series of gas grills. They packed performance into an eye-catching form and created freestanding grills with carts that are more than just a stand for a grill.  Phantom Matte Black Finished Surfaces If you dont want to be like everybody else on the block with a shiny silver-ish grill, Napoleons Phantom Rogue SE 425 RSIB Propane Grill offers edgy styling with luxurious, silky black matte finishes. Napoleon refers to it as low-key luxury, but it's more than just a look  these grills offer high performance AND high styling! Infrared Rear Rotisserie Burner Perfect for high heat searing and slow spit roasting for succulent roasted meals. (Rotisserie kit sold separately) Large Infrared Sizzle Zone™ Side Burner Get the perfect steakhouse-quality sear! The Phantom Rogue SE 425 RSIB's IR side burner is more efficient and gets much hotter (up to 1,800 degrees F!) than a conventional burner, giving it the power to quickly sear meat and deliver the much-desired caramelized crust, sealing in flavor and juices. With an infrared burner, you're actually cooking with the power of light energy. 3 Stainless Steel Burners Burners are the heart of any gas grill. Napoleon's 16-gauge premium 304 stainless steel burner tubes are reinforced and feature an industry-leading design that provides proven longevity, performance, and efficiency. Complete combustion is the key, and these burners balance fuel and oxygen to generate a clean burn. Dual gas ports on the top and sides of each burner ensure even heating along the burner and produced fewer flare-ups. Instant JETFIRE™ Ignition  If a grill doesn't reliably light, it's not a reliable grill. Napoleon's Instant JETFIRE ignition lights the first time, every time. The design sends a jet of flame to light each burner individually. You can light your grill with the twist of your writs. Batteries not required! With cross-lighting burners, in the unlikely event that a burner goes out or fails to light, it automatically relights. There's a cross-light bracket between burners that passes flame to the unlit burner, assuring safe and reliable grilling. High Top Lid Napoleon Rogue heavy-duty high top lids pivot on a central point to keep the opening within the same space as the body of the grill. In addition, though the lids are heavy, the design provides leverage to easily lift the grill's lid. The higher height gives you space to grill larger meats, and the double layer of insulation works to keep the heat in and helps it circulate for greater heat control. Stainless Steel Iconic Wave Cooking Grids Never underestimate the power of heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grids! As you can see, the Wave design is like no other and it's not just because they look cool. The wave encourages even heating and provides more surface area, prevents food from falling through, and keeps the grill cleaner. The shape increases the grates' longevity by allowing for even expansion and contraction, reducing the effect that heat and cold have on the metal. Backlit Ergonomic Control Knobs Like the feel of a steering wheel, or the knobs of a high-end stereo, the smooth grip and robust shape of the Rogue knobs give you excellent control. Illuminated to prevent the where do I have everything set? guessing game after the sun goes down. A Grill Cart that is Much More than Just a Cart The Phantom Rogue SE 425 RSIB's cart is functional and offers features not generally found at this price point. The enclosed design protects the contents from the elements and provides long-lasting durability. Each cart includes a built-in propane tank ring to secure the tank and improve safety, especially when moving the grill. There are tool hooks on each side shelf to help you keep your grilling tools within reach without cluttering up the stainless steel folding shelf, and a condiment basket to store your favorite spices and sauces. The cart rests on locking casters for extra stability.

The porous stone pulls moisture away from your pizza crust, pastries, and breads, yielding crispy and light results. The stone is a natural heat conductor and distributes heat evenly. You can use a Baking Stone to ensure that your barbecue or oven are heating evenly, increasing efficiency when baking. The natural surface doesn't retain odors and flavors; so last week's garlic pizza won't flavor this week's homestyle honey biscuits. Like your favorite cast iron frying pan, this stone will season over time, creating a non-stick surface and making it more effective. It is recommended that you hand wash your premium pizza stone by hand, with warm water, once completely cooled. Avoid soapy water and scrubbing. Whether you are cooking a fresh or frozen pizza, reheating last night's pizza, or baking your favorite pastries, cookies, breads, or desserts, the pizza stone ensures the best results.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Pairing best with seafood, cedar is also great for flavoring vegetables, tofu, pork, chicken and steak. The cooking process produces both smoke and steam which will keep your food moist and flavorful. Napoleon Cedar grilling planks are thicker than most other planks on the market. This means that they are reusable. Simply pre-soak the 100% untreated natural cedar planks in cold water for at least one hour before use to ensure consistent burn and smoke. Then place the plank and food onto a preheated barbecue. When the food is finished, rinse the cedar barbecue plank thoroughly with water and scrape off any food residue. Any stubborn residue can be sanded off. Do not use soap. Allow the plank to dry completely before storing. A plank can be reused until it is approximately 50% charred. The Cedar grilling plank is great for experimental grillers and impressing your guests, these hassle-free planks are easy to use and disposable.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
