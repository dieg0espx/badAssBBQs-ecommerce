The Platinum Smart-Heat patio heater is the premier electric heater available on the market. With a 3400 Watt (11,600 BTU) output, the heater can heat a 64 square feet area quickly and efficiently. It has multiple mounting options, so it can be attached to the wall, ceiling, or even recessed. Its wafer-thin 2-inch low profile makes it highly wind resistant, and its sealed case makes its weather resistance excellent. The included bracket allows for 60 degrees of motion so you can direct the heat where you want it. The tinted glass cover allows the heat to get through but subdues the light, letting the heater emit a soft red glow instead of the harsh orange glare found on lesser infrared heaters. The stainless steel construction makes it perfect for residential and commercial installations. The Platinum Electric heater can be controlled via simple wall switch, or wirelessly with the optional wireless controller or wireless dimmer controller. This heater uses 240V AC current and must be hard-wired by a licensed electrician.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesHeats areas up to 200 square feet, twice the area of other portable heatersThe high-performance mesh screen manipulates infrared energy giving wind resistance up to 8 mphPatented flame failure and tilt safety technology ensures risk-free operation at all timesOne-Touch ignition lets you light heater quickly and easilyRadiates heat evenly so warmth is directed toward people and deep into open areasBromic Heating leads the market in supplying your outdoor patio with radiant heaters that demonstrate outstanding performance and unbeatable quality. Unlike the elements on dome or mushroom style portable patio heaters, the 38,500 BTU natural gas infrared directional standing Tungsten heating element does not suffer from vertical heat loss. Most heaters heat the air around them. As that hot air rises, the heater ends up heating the air above them instead of the people and space around them. The radiant heater element on the Bromic Tungsten Freestanding Portable Heater heats directionally to warm 200 square feet, up to twice the area of other portable dome, mushroom or tower style heaters. The heat radiates evenly so the warmth is directed toward people and deep into open areas. A single push of a button starts the heater, and a control knob allows you to increase or decrease the heat output as needed. The Bromic-patented wind resistance technology lets this heater work in winds with gusts of up to 11mph while remaining lit. If the flame is blown out, the built-in regulator automatically disables the supply of gas. The tower style modular design allows for easy dis-assembly and storage in the off season.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Platinum Smart-Heat patio heater is the premier electric heater available on the market. With a 3400 Watt (11,600 BTU) output, the heater can heat a 64 square feet area quickly and efficiently. It has multiple mounting options, so it can be attached to the wall, ceiling, or even recessed. Its wafer-thin 2-inch low profile makes it highly wind resistant, and its sealed case makes its weather resistance excellent. The included bracket allows for 60 degrees of motion so you can direct the heat where you want it. The tinted glass cover allows the heat to get through but subdues the light, letting the heater emit a soft red glow instead of the harsh orange glare found on lesser infrared heaters. The stainless steel construction makes it perfect for residential and commercial installations. The Platinum Electric heater can be controlled via simple wall switch, or wirelessly with the optional wireless controller or wireless dimmer controller. This heater uses 240V AC current and must be hard-wired by a licensed electrician. Please consult a licensed electrician to determine suitability for purpose.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Platinum Smart-Heat patio heater is the premier electric heater available on the market. With a 2300 Watt (7,900 BTU) output, the heater can heat a 64 square feet area quickly and efficiently. It has multiple mounting options, so it can be attached to the wall, ceiling, or even recessed. Its wafer-thin 2-inch low profile makes it highly wind resistant, and its sealed case makes its weather resistance excellent. The included bracket allows for 60 degrees of motion so you can direct the heat where you want it. The tinted glass cover allows the heat to get through but subdues the light, letting the heater emit a soft red glow instead of the harsh orange glare found on lesser infrared heaters. The stainless steel construction makes it perfect for residential and commercial installations. The Platinum Electric heater can be controlled via simple wall switch, or wirelessly with the optional wireless controller or wireless dimmer controller.

Unlike the elements on dome or mushroom style portable patio heaters, the 38,500 BTU infrared directional standing Tungsten heating element does not suffer from vertical heat loss. Most heaters heat the air around them. As that hot air rises, the heater ends up heating the air above them instead of the people and space around them. The radiant heater element on the Bromic Tungsten Freestanding Portable Heater heats directionally to warm 200 square feet, up to twice the area of other portable dome, mushroom or tower style propane heaters. The heat radiates evenly so the warmth is directed toward people and deep into open areas. A single push of a button starts the heater, and a control knob allows you to increase or decrease the heat output as needed. The Bromic-patented wind resistance technology lets this heater work in winds with gusts of up to 11mph while remaining lit. If the flame is blown out, the built-in regulator automatically disables the supply of gas. The tower style modular design allows for easy dis-assembly and storage in the off season.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Platinum Smart-Heat patio heater is the premier electric heater available on the market. With a 2300 Watt (7,900 BTU) output, the heater can heat a 64 square feet area quickly and efficiently. It has multiple mounting options, so it can be attached to the wall, ceiling, or even recessed. Its wafer-thin 2-inch low profile makes it highly wind resistant, and its sealed case makes its weather resistance excellent. The included bracket allows for 60 degrees of motion so you can direct the heat where you want it. The tinted glass cover allows the heat to get through but subdues the light, letting the heater emit a soft red glow instead of the harsh orange glare found on lesser infrared heaters. The stainless steel construction makes it perfect for residential and commercial installations. The Platinum Electric heater can be controlled via simple wall switch, or wirelessly with the optional wireless controller or wireless dimmer controller. This heater uses 240V AC current and must be hard-wired by a licensed electrician. Please consult a licensed electrician to determine suitability for purpose.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

This Tungsten Smart-Heat patio heater stands out against standard patio heaters since it is equipped with a spectral reflector for distributing 4,000 Watts of radiant heat evenly and heat areas up to 130 square feet. The infrared heating element tubes are frosted to reduce the harsh glare, producing a warm, attractive amber glow. The Tungsten Smart-Heat infrared electric patio heater can be wall or ceiling-mounted and wired into smart system controls to fit custom heating preferences. Wall and ceiling mounting options allow you to easily adjust the flow of heat for better, custom directional heating. The heater has a corrosion-resistant, high temperature coating, and a tamper-proof electrical wiring enclosure to help extend its life and quality.
