        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durability1/2 inch diameter Hexagonal stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for heat retention and searingExact Control Illumination LED in each burner control knob changes colors to indicate burner temperatureTempTrack illumination above the control panel provides an easy to read indication of overall grill temperatureBlack glass concealed infrared rotisserie burners distribute heat more evenly across more surface area than standard burnersThe Eagle One Series combines luxury grilling innovations found in Twin Eagles C Series gas grills with all-new, exclusive features to create a super premium grilling experience. The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. Two individually controlled concealed infrared rotisserie burners sit behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 54-inch grill has three 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary.

The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. Two individually controlled concealed infrared rotisserie burners sit behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 54-inch grill has three 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durability1/2 inch diameter Hexagonal stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for heat retention and searingExact Control Illumination LED in each burner control knob changes colors to indicate burner temperatureTempTrack illumination above the control panel provides an easy to read indication of overall grill temperatureBlack glass concealed infrared rotisserie burner distributes heat more evenly across more surface area than standard burnersThe Eagle One Series combines luxury grilling innovations found in Twin Eagles C Series gas grills with all-new, exclusive features to create a super premium grilling experience. The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. A concealed infrared rotisserie burner sits behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 42-inch grill has two 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durability1/2 inch diameter Hexagonal stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for heat retention and searingExact Control Illumination LED in each burner control knob changes colors to indicate burner temperatureTempTrack illumination above the control panel provides an easy to read indication of overall grill temperatureBlack glass concealed infrared rotisserie burner distributes heat more evenly across more surface area than standard burnersThe Eagle One Series combines luxury grilling innovations found in Twin Eagles C Series gas grills with all-new, exclusive features to create a super premium grilling experience. The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. A concealed infrared rotisserie burner sits behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 42-inch grill has two 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durabilityHexagon-shaped stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for searingIndigo Blue Exclusive Control Illumination provides precise control knob settingIntegrated, hidden rotisserie system with chain driven spit that will support up to 100lbs of meatLarge capacity sealed smoker box lets you add unique flavor to grilled foodsTwin Eagles has mastered the secret sauce in grilling perfection with their innovative Five-Part Grilling System that is designed for the ultimate grilling synergy. Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 42-inch grill has three (3) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durabilityHexagon-shaped stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for searingIndigo Blue Exclusive Control Illumination provides precise control knob settingIntegrated, hidden rotisserie system with chain driven spit that will support up to 100lbs of meatLarge capacity sealed smoker box lets you add unique flavor to grilled foodsTwin Eagles has mastered the secret sauce in grilling perfection with their innovative Five-Part Grilling System that is designed for the ultimate grilling synergy. Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 42-inch grill has three (3) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability.

The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 36-inch grill has three (3) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durabilityHexagon-shaped stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for searingIndigo Blue Exclusive Control Illumination provides precise control knob settingIntegrated, hidden rotisserie system with chain driven spit that will support up to 100lbs of meatLarge capacity sealed smoker box lets you add unique flavor to grilled foodsTwin Eagles has mastered the secret sauce in grilling perfection with their innovative Five-Part Grilling System that is designed for the ultimate grilling synergy. Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 36-inch grill has two (2) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat, one (1) 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner, and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 36-inch grill has three (3) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durabilityHexagon-shaped stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for searingIndigo Blue Exclusive Control Illumination provides precise control knob settingIntegrated, hidden rotisserie system with chain driven spit that will support up to 100lbs of meatLarge capacity sealed smoker box lets you add unique flavor to grilled foodsTwin Eagles has mastered the secret sauce in grilling perfection with their innovative Five-Part Grilling System that is designed for the ultimate grilling synergy. Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 30-inch grill has one (1) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat, one (1) 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner, and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

        "Description": "Key FeaturesTwin Eagles grills are made in the USA with 304 stainless steel offering quality construction and lasting durabilityHexagon-shaped stainless steel cooking rods are extra thick for searingIndigo Blue Exclusive Control Illumination provides precise control knob settingIntegrated, hidden rotisserie system with chain driven spit that will support up to 100lbs of meatLarge capacity sealed smoker box lets you add unique flavor to grilled foodsTwin Eagles has mastered the secret sauce in grilling perfection with their innovative Five-Part Grilling System that is designed for the ultimate grilling synergy. Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 30-inch grill has two (2) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated infrared rotisserie burner and motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
