The heavily-textured, cafe blanco finish will develop a patina and naturally weather over time, making this fireplace uniquely your own. The 18-inch logs are handcrafted by artisans from actual wood samples to carefully recreate the intricate bark detail and natural coloration of deeply charred wood. Steel rods are inserted to each log to provide maximum reinforcement to ensure they retain their strength, even while burning at high temperatures. The match-lit, ANSI certified vent-free natural gas burner is made from stainless steel for outdoor durability and features a realistic burning display with glowing embers which makes the gas logs more visually stunning.

The heavily-textured, cafe blanco finish will develop a patina and naturally weather over time, making this fireplace uniquely your own. The 24-inch logs are handcrafted by artisans from actual wood samples to carefully recreate the intricate bark detail and natural coloration of deeply charred wood. Steel rods are inserted to each log to provide maximum reinforcement to ensure they retain their strength, even while burning at high temperatures. The match-lit, ANSI certified vent-free natural gas burner is made from stainless steel for outdoor durability and features a realistic burning display with glowing embers which makes the gas logs more visually stunning. For easy installation, the Cordova fireplace assembles with the included bolts and has a gas shut off conveniently located on the back right of the fireplace.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Handcrafted in the USA from pre-cast reinforced concrete, this fireplace is made to withstand nearly any outdoor climate. The firebox is made from refractory cement, a specially designed material that endures high temperatures without cracking or chipping. The heavily-textured, cafe blanco finish will develop a patina and naturally weather over time, making this fireplace uniquely your own. This fireplace also includes an extended bullnose hearth and two side walls with deep molding detail. The 18-inch logs are handcrafted by artisans from actual wood samples to carefully recreate the intricate bark detail and natural coloration of deeply charred wood. Steel rods are inserted to each log to provide maximum reinforcement to ensure they retain their strength, even while burning at high temperatures. The match-lit, ANSI certified vent-free natural gas burner is made from stainless steel for outdoor durability and features a realistic burning display with glowing embers which makes the gas logs more visually stunning. For easy installation, the Grand Mariposa fireplace assembles with the included bolts and has a gas shut off conveniently located on the back right of the fireplace.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Handcrafted in the USA from pre-cast reinforced concrete, this fireplace is made to withstand nearly any outdoor climate. The firebox is made from refractory cement, a specially designed material that endures high temperatures without cracking or chipping. The heavily-textured, cafe blanco finish will develop a patina and naturally weather over time, making this fireplace uniquely your own. This outdoor fireplace sits upon an 110-inch radiused bullnose hearth which adds splendor to the design. The 24-inch logs are handcrafted by artisans from actual wood samples to carefully recreate the intricate bark detail and natural coloration of deeply charred wood. Steel rods are inserted to each log to provide maximum reinforcement to ensure they retain their strength, even while burning at high temperatures. The match-lit, natural gas burner is made from stainless steel for outdoor durability and features a T-shape, which creates more glowing embers and a small row of flames in the front, adding more realism in this outdoor fireplace. For easy installation, the Cordova fireplace assembles with the included bolts and has a gas shut off conveniently located on the back right of the fireplace.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
