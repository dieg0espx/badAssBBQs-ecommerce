Choice Series grills are the most affordable line that Fire Magic offers, featuring superior design and materials inside Aurora-style housing. In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User Accessible collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. They also feature a suite of enhancements designed to assist individuals with disabilities. The CMA430S freestanding natural gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel. The modified control knobs are easier to manipulate and are made with locking pins as an anti-theft measure. As an accessibility upgrade, the hood is spring assisted, and includes a handle on the side for easy opening and closing. Integrated into the hood are a wind guard to prevent airflow into the exhaust vent, and an analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, two 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 46,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 432 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. The grill is mounted to a sturdy patio post with a wide base, perfect for portable installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. For the Accessible collection, the grill is lower on the post mount than on normal Choice grills, with the cooking surface sitting at 32 inches high instead of 37. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty. Designed with frequent use and abuse in mind, and with enhanced accessibility, the Choice Multi-User Accessible collection of grills from Fire Magic is the perfect luxury option for any common use area.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A790I built-in natural gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is a 20,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightHot surface ignition lights your grill reliably and quicklyKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A790I built-in propane gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A540I built-in natural gas grill features 540 square inches of premium cooking space, wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 63,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A790I built-in natural gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E790i grill features two cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 64,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 792 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 13,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before.

Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup.

These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 792 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 13,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features two cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features two cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features three cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features two cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features two cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E790i grill features two cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 64,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 792 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 13,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E790i grill features two cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 64,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 792 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 13,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Inside, this E790i grill features three cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 96,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 792 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 13,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features two cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features three cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features three cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Inside, this E1060s grill features four cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 112,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup.

These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. This model also boasts a 60,000 BTU power burner on the left side, perfect for wok cooking, turkey frying, or seafood boiling.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E1060s grill features four cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 112,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. This model also boasts a 60,000 BTU power burner on the left side, perfect for wok cooking, turkey frying, or seafood boiling. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E1060i grill features three cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 84,000 BTUs. The fourth burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E1060i grill features three cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 84,000 BTUs. The fourth burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E1060i grill features four cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 112,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. The Magic View Window lets you monitor your food without lifting the hood and losing heat. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

Inside, this E1060i grill features four cast stainless steel propane burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 112,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E1060i grill features three cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 84,000 BTUs. The fourth burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 1056 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 22,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E790i grill features two cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 64,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 792 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 13,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. The grill is mounted to a sturdy patio post with a wide base, perfect for portable installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty. With features designed for durability, reliability, and low-cost operation, the Choice Multi-User collection of grills from Fire Magic is the perfect luxury option for any common use area.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightHot surface ignition lights your grill reliably and quicklyKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A830I built-in propane gas/charcoal combo grill combines the best of both worlds in outdoor cooking. 828 total square inches of cooking space (432 sq. in. on the gas side and 396 sq. in. on the charcoal side) provide an impressive amount of versatility that allows this masterpiece to truly shine. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting on the gas side. Two separate double walled hoods feature spring assist hardware for ease and accessibility. They open 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Analog thermometers are integrated into both hoods, with angled bezels for easier viewing. The charcoal side features an adjustable height charcoal tray, letting you control the amount of heat that reaches the cooking surface. A 26,000 BTU burner below the charcoal tray is used to quickly ignite your charcoal or wood chunks. Both the gas and charcoal sides feature patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which are designed with a trapezoidal shape to optimally transfer heat from the fire to your food. An adjustable warming rack also sits above the cooking surface on either side, for a little extra space to keep food hot while waiting for the rest to cook. Generating heat on the gas side are a cast stainless steel E burner with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, and a left side infrared burner that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. For night time grilling, the interior of the gas side of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A830I built-in natural gas/charcoal combo grill combines the best of both worlds in outdoor cooking. 828 total square inches of cooking space (432 sq. in. on the gas side and 396 sq. in. on the charcoal side) provide an impressive amount of versatility that allows this masterpiece to truly shine. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting on the gas side. Two separate double walled hoods feature spring assist hardware for ease and accessibility. They open 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Analog thermometers are integrated into both hoods, with angled bezels for easier viewing. The charcoal side features an adjustable height charcoal tray, letting you control the amount of heat that reaches the cooking surface. A 26,000 BTU burner below the charcoal tray is used to quickly ignite your charcoal or wood chunks. Both the gas and charcoal sides feature patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which are designed with a trapezoidal shape to optimally transfer heat from the fire to your food. An adjustable warming rack also sits above the cooking surface on either side, for a little extra space to keep food hot while waiting for the rest to cook. Generating heat on the gas side are two cast stainless steel E-burners, with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. For night time grilling, the interior of the gas side of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Integrated smart technology allows remote control from a smartphone. The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features three cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesThe Multi-User Accessible collection adds additional features to assist those with disabilitiesA lower cooking surface and spring assisted hood with side handle add accessibilityCooking grids, warming rack, and control knobs are locked to the grill to prevent theftOne hour gas shutoff timer is built in to prevent fire hazards or higher gas costsFire Magic grills and accessories are proudly made in the USAKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a quality outdoor cooking experience. Choice Series grills are the most affordable line that Fire Magic offers, featuring superior design and materials inside Aurora-style housing. In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User Accessible collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. They also feature a suite of enhancements designed to assist individuals with disabilities. The CMA430S freestanding natural gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel. The modified control knobs are easier to manipulate and are made with locking pins as an anti-theft measure. As an accessibility upgrade, the hood is spring assisted, and includes a handle on the side for easy opening and closing. Integrated into the hood are a wind guard to prevent airflow into the exhaust vent, and an analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, two 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 46,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 432 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. The grill is mounted to a sturdy in-ground post, perfect for permanent installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. For the Accessible collection, the grill is lower on the post mount than on normal Choice grills, with the cooking surface sitting at 32 inches high instead of 37. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty. Designed with frequent use and abuse in mind, and with enhanced accessibility, the Choice Multi-User Accessible collection of grills from Fire Magic is the perfect luxury option for any common use area.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Choice Series grills are the most affordable line that Fire Magic offers, featuring superior design and materials inside Aurora-style housing. In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. The CM650I built-in natural gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel. The knobs are made with locking pins as an anti-theft measure. Integrated into the hood are a wind guard to prevent airflow into the exhaust vent, and an analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, three 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 69,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 648 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty.

Inside, two 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 46,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 432 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. The grill is mounted to a sturdy in-ground post, perfect for permanent installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty. With features designed for durability, reliability, and low-cost operation, the Choice Multi-User collection of grills from Fire Magic is the perfect luxury option for any common use area.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Title": "Fire Magic Aurora A830I 46-Inch Built-In Propane Gas & Charcoal Combo Grill With Rotisserie And Analog Thermometer - A830I-8EAP-CB",
    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A830I built-in propane gas/charcoal combo grill combines the best of both worlds in outdoor cooking. 828 total square inches of cooking space (432 sq. in. on the gas side and 396 sq. in. on the charcoal side) provide an impressive amount of versatility that allows this masterpiece to truly shine. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting on the gas side. Two separate double walled hoods feature spring assist hardware for ease and accessibility. They open 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Analog thermometers are integrated into both hoods, with angled bezels for easier viewing. The charcoal side features an adjustable height charcoal tray, letting you control the amount of heat that reaches the cooking surface. A 26,000 BTU burner below the charcoal tray is used to quickly ignite your charcoal or wood chunks. Both the gas and charcoal sides feature patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which are designed with a trapezoidal shape to optimally transfer heat from the fire to your food. An adjustable warming rack also sits above the cooking surface on either side, for a little extra space to keep food hot while waiting for the rest to cook. Generating heat on the gas side are two cast stainless steel E-burners, with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. In the rear of the grill is a 13,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the gas side of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightHot surface ignition lights your grill reliably and quicklyKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A430S freestanding propane gas grill features 432 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features two cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. The grill comes on a stainless steel cart which includes two storage doors, a slide-out propane tank, and two side shelves. One of these shelves folds down while the other contains a flush mounted 15,000 BTU side burner for extra cooking versatility. Locking casters keep the cart in place. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Choice Series grills are the most affordable line that Fire Magic offers, featuring superior design and materials inside Aurora-style housing. In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User Accessible collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. They also feature a suite of enhancements designed to assist individuals with disabilities. The CMA430S freestanding propane gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel. The modified control knobs are easier to manipulate and are made with locking pins as an anti-theft measure. As an accessibility upgrade, the hood is spring assisted, and includes a handle on the side for easy opening and closing. Integrated into the hood are a wind guard to prevent airflow into the exhaust vent, and an analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, two 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 46,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 432 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. The grill is mounted to a sturdy patio post with a wide base, perfect for portable installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. For the Accessible collection, the grill is lower on the post mount than on normal Choice grills, with the cooking surface sitting at 32 inches high instead of 37. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty.

Choice Series grills are the most affordable line that Fire Magic offers, featuring superior design and materials inside Aurora-style housing. In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. The CM430S freestanding propane gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel. The knobs are made with locking pins as an anti-theft measure. Integrated into the hood are a wind guard to prevent airflow into the exhaust vent, and an analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, two 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 46,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 432 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. The grill is mounted to a sturdy patio post with a wide base, perfect for portable installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A790I built-in natural gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features two cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, and a left side infrared burner that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is a 20,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesMagic View Window made of heat-resistant ceramic glass allows you to monitor your food without lifting the hoodDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A790I built-in propane gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Built into the hood is the Magic View Window. This heat resistant ceramic glass window is designed to operate at temperatures up to 1,400 degrees. It lets you monitor the interior of your grill without having to lift the lid, thus losing precious heat. An analog thermometer is integrated into the hood and window, with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is a 20,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A660I built-in natural gas grill features 660 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features two cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, and a left side infrared burner that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an 18,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A660I built-in propane gas grill features 660 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an 18,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A430I built-in natural gas grill features 432 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features two cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is a 13,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups.

The double-walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Inside, this E660i grill features two cast stainless steel natural gas burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. The third burner is a 25,000 BTU infrared searing burner, capable of reaching 1000\u00b0F. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The 660 sq. in. cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an infrared backburner for the included heavy duty rotisserie kit that produces 11,000 BTUs. For nighttime grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by three halogen lights. A large drip tray with ball bearing glides makes cleanup with the disposable drip pan system even easier than before. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into an outdoor kitchen. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With all these premium features, the Echelon Diamond series from Fire Magic defines luxury grilling.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesMagic View Window made of heat-resistant ceramic glass allows you to monitor your food without lifting the hoodDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A790I built-in natural gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Built into the hood is the Magic View Window. This heat resistant ceramic glass window is designed to operate at temperatures up to 1,400 degrees. It lets you monitor the interior of your grill without having to lift the lid, thus losing precious heat. An analog thermometer is integrated into the hood and window, with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightHot surface ignition lights your grill reliably and quicklyKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A660I built-in propane gas grill features 660 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. The CM540I built-in propane gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel.

They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced.

The Aurora A830I built-in propane gas/charcoal combo grill combines the best of both worlds in outdoor cooking. 828 total square inches of cooking space (432 sq. in. on the gas side and 396 sq. in. on the charcoal side) provide an impressive amount of versatility that allows this masterpiece to truly shine. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, along with sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting on the gas side. Two separate double walled hoods feature spring assist hardware for ease and accessibility. They open 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Analog thermometers are integrated into both hoods, with angled bezels for easier viewing. The charcoal side features an adjustable height charcoal tray, letting you control the amount of heat that reaches the cooking surface. A 26,000 BTU burner below the charcoal tray is used to quickly ignite your charcoal or wood chunks. Both the gas and charcoal sides feature patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which are designed with a trapezoidal shape to optimally transfer heat from the fire to your food. An adjustable warming rack also sits above the cooking surface on either side, for a little extra space to keep food hot while waiting for the rest to cook. Generating heat on the gas side are two cast stainless steel E-burners, with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. For night time grilling, the interior of the gas side of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

The Aurora A790I built-in natural gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Built into the hood is the Magic View Window. This heat resistant ceramic glass window is designed to operate at temperatures up to 1,400 degrees. It lets you monitor the interior of your grill without having to lift the lid, thus losing precious heat. An analog thermometer is integrated into the hood and window, with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features two cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, and a left side infrared burner that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is a 20,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A830I built-in natural gas/charcoal combo grill combines the best of both worlds in outdoor cooking. 828 total square inches of cooking space (432 sq. in. on the gas side and 396 sq. in. on the charcoal side) provide an impressive amount of versatility that allows this masterpiece to truly shine. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting on the gas side. Two separate double walled hoods feature spring assist hardware for ease and accessibility. They open 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Analog thermometers are integrated into both hoods, with angled bezels for easier viewing. The charcoal side features an adjustable height charcoal tray, letting you control the amount of heat that reaches the cooking surface. A 26,000 BTU burner below the charcoal tray is used to quickly ignite your charcoal or wood chunks. Both the gas and charcoal sides feature patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which are designed with a trapezoidal shape to optimally transfer heat from the fire to your food. An adjustable warming rack also sits above the cooking surface on either side, for a little extra space to keep food hot while waiting for the rest to cook. Generating heat on the gas side are two cast stainless steel E-burners, with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. In the rear of the grill is a 13,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the gas side of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced.

The Aurora A540I built-in natural gas grill features 540 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 63,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an 18,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesMagic View Window made of heat-resistant ceramic glass allows you to monitor your food without lifting the hoodDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A790I built-in natural gas grill features 792 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Built into the hood is the Magic View Window. This heat resistant ceramic glass window is designed to operate at temperatures up to 1,400 degrees. It lets you monitor the interior of your grill without having to lift the lid, thus losing precious heat. An analog thermometer is integrated into the hood and window, with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 90,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is a 20,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "Key FeaturesAurora grills offer performance, versatility, and style with many of the same features as the Echelon SeriesDiamond Sear cooking grids feature a wide, flat top, optimally transferring heat from the burner to the cooking surfaceCast stainless steel burners are heavy and durable, featuring precision porting for more even heatIncludes rear rotisserie burner and rotisserie kit, so you can grill and roast at the same timeBack-lit LED control knobs and interior halogen lights let you grill day or nightKnown for crafting American-made premium grills for over 75 years, Fire Magic is dedicated to providing you with a luxurious outdoor cooking experience. The Aurora A540I built-in propane gas grill features 540 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 63,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an 18,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.Legal disclaimers and warnings\n\nProduct packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
