Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. 3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. Blue Knob Lighting You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Interior Halogen Lighting Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.

Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism. Super-cool Design Reminiscent of a 1969 Shelby Mustang GT 350 You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car. In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54\" version!). It's the kind of unique styling that makes people stop and stare and wonder where they've seen it before. And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could. Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including the 14-gauge burners , 12-gauge burner covers , reversible 9-gauge V-shaped cooking grates , and 16-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist , the AMG Encore Hybrid grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark. Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. Stainless Steel Grill Cart with Ample Storage Talk about grilling convenience! The Encore 36\" Hybrid Propane Grill Cart features soft-close drawers, including a large drawer to store charcoal and wood, a propane tank storage drawer, a folding shelf with a cutting board, a towel holder, locking and non-locking caster wheels, and it arrives fully assembled .

And best of all, when you run it wide open this baby smells much more appetizing than any car possibly could.

Blue Knob Lighting Is there anything more annoying than having to guess at what levels your burners are set? The American Made Grill Encore series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing after dark. Interior Halogen Lighting Open the hood, and halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface to make it easy to check the progress of your food after the sun goes down.

Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. 3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Stainless Steel Construction Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. Blue Knob Lighting You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Interior Halogen Lighting Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental \"suntan\" on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done.
